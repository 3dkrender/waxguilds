### <ins>Marketing</ins>

**A) Onboarding on WAX through Monster Rooms, part 3**: We are continuing to onboard users on WAX through Monster Rooms. This time, we airdropped a free Acryptia Custom Deck (an NFT which is exclusively on WAX) to all the Monster Rooms PFP holders who connected their WAX and Solana wallet. A lot of players created a WAX wallet to receive the perk, and they're now actively playing Acryptia. 

**B) 20B WUF distributed**: We distributed 10B WUF to Monster Rooms PFP holders. We're going to distributed 10 more B on July 29th. With multiple usecases attached to WUF on the WAX chain (MEAL, events, utility) this is another instrument to bring more users on WAX.

We don't have any feedback right now to share with the OIG, other that we really like the new guild report format: it helps to create a standard between guilds easily. Thanks!
