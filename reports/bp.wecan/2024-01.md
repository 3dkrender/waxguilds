Incidents
1. We've been investigating AA API availability checks in Sentinel's validator.
There's more or less correlation between update from 1.3.31 to 1.3.24/24-update and stability of most of the mainnet AA API checks in Sentinel.
We've weached out to Sentinel and Charles and thanks to his quick response and availability.
It's not clear how things connected but AA API of most BPs was very stable on 1.3.21 up until recently.

What has been done:
1. Upgrade of public mainnet Atomic API to 1.3.24 and 1.3.24-update
2. Increased amount of our mainnet Light-API backends and migration to new infra workflow
3. Upgraded our internal history ship balancing and healthchecking

WIP:
1. Consolidation of containerized infra

We are pleased to provide you with an update on the development of the R-Planet game. Devs have been working on numerous features and improvements.

_**Reordering buildings on the base**_

With the following update, the player can reorder buildings within their base, making a more comfortable experience for them. The player is able to relocate any building, to any location on that base, except mines.

_**Changed Unit Production Process**_

**- instant withdrawal of all required resources**
The unit production process has undergone a significant change in order to optimize game performance, enhance reliability, and eliminate temporary resource-hiding issues.
Now, upon confirmation of the unit production action, all required resources will be instantly withdrawn for the entire lot of pre-ordered units as soon as production begins. Additionally, unit-related achievements will be applied immediately after production initiation, providing a seamless gaming experience.

**- addition of more units to an existing task**
Changes in the unit production process. Unit production has been modified to simplify the addition of more units to an existing task. The player no longer needs to cancel the order to add more units to production.

_**Bew Types of NFTs on WAX have been created**_

We issued new types of NFTs on WAX, such as the newest hero, Walter, and the Rare, and Epic Hero Gear.

_**Importing of New Types of NFTs from the WAX Chain Has Been Implemented**_

Holding and transferring Walter Hero and the Rare and Epic Hero Gear on WAX has been enabled in the game.

_**Basic Settings of the Heroes Were Changed**_

In order to distinguish all the NFT heroes, we’ve boosted a chosen basic property for each of them.


**Improvements and bug fixes**

1. The images of larger and smaller bases were redrawn in order to distinguish large and small bases better.
2. The name of the server has been added to the Game Info page so the player is able to navigate and orient themselves between servers more easily.
3. The bug in the combat calculator was fixed. The bug involved the combat calculator altering the local state of the player’s base. For instance, using the combat calculator resulted in a visual change in the building level.

**Community Engagement**

Our players have been provided with the assistance of our moderators in different social handles like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram chat. 

_**Hero and Gear Items Sale**_


We held a [Hero and Gear Items Sale](https://rplanet.io/drop?ids=24-25-26) of new NFT assets issued on WAX. 
The sale was launched at 3 pm UTC on December 14. There were three types of items available, such as us:
