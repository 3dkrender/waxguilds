### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

1. Deployed testing nodeos cluster as testnet api poc
2. Resolved multiple internal hiccups that cloudflare ended up with when they forcefully switched everyone to http2 on origins
3. Assisting with deployment of WAX infra from our backup storage

Delayed a lot of work due to NDA project, but:

1. Still - WIP Datadog monitoring lib suite - completed delphioracle and bp block tracking, as well as api monitoring. p2p in progress, wrapping everything in portable format.
2. Still - WIP IBC - deployed testing proof server on testnet eos and wax envs, figuring out what to do next.
