### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

We had an incident with internal testnet network which caused downtime for history nodes so it took a couple of hours to recover the testnet hyperion indexer for some reason.
The reason is being investigated:

the reason was in poor condition of one of the switches in the failover history node which made it flap.
node was migrated out of there.

No other issues over the past 1.5 months.
