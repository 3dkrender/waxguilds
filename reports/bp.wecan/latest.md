**Update**:

The tasks listed below indicate ongoing development efforts and completed tasks within the project:

2. Added UI Popups
To enhance the user experience, several new UI popups have been added:
Hero Quest Completed: Notifies players when their hero has successfully completed a quest.
Hero Died: Alerts players when their hero has died.
Reward Image: Displays a visual representation of rewards earned.
XP Earned: Shows the amount of experience points gained.
3. Enhanced Bases Summary Page
The bases summary page has been enriched with more detailed information to improve player convenience (Additional Indicators, Activity Visualization)
4. Concept of Premium Accounts
We have developed a concept for Premium accounts, aimed at providing enhanced features and benefits to players who opt for this tier. 
These developments are part of our continuous effort to improve the gameplay experience and provide more detailed, accessible information to our players. 


The R-Planet game's development is well underway, with tasks at multiple phases. Both design and development teams are making steady progress. Ongoing teamwork and dedicated efforts are focused on refining the gaming experience and aligning with user expectations.

Moderator Assistance
Our players have been actively supported by our dedicated moderators across various social platforms such as Discord, Twitter, and Telegram chats. This ongoing assistance has ensured that player queries are addressed promptly, enhancing their overall gaming experience and fostering a strong community spirit.

__Participation in Top Web3 Conference in Dubai__
R-Planet participated as a silver sponsor in the Top Web3 Conference in Dubai (https://web3dubai.io/). During the event, we showcased the unique concept of our game, highlighting its distinctive features and future potential.
