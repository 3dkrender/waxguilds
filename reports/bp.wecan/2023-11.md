The key features and improvements include:

**Alliance Unions: Enhancing Player Cooperation**

With this feature, any alliance will be able to establish partnership unions to collaborate with other alliances towards shared objectives. It also extends the role of alliance administrators. They will be able to establish alliance unions and identify hostile alliances. With this development, all members within an alliance gain the ability to distinguish between the bases of members from friendly and hostile alliances. They will be marked with different colors. This knowledge is crucial for deciding whether to initiate an attack or provide support.


**Alliance Invitations**
The next feature our developers are working on also applies to alliances. We are about to implement an invitation system, allowing admins and managers to invite any player to the alliance with the usage of a single button. This will include the ability to:
Send an invitation
Review the list of invitations
Delete an invitation
In turn, players will be able to either reject or accept an invitation. With this feature, alliance leaders gain a very useful toolkit to invite people from nearby locations with appropriate development levels or other specifications.


**Visual Display of User Inactivity**

The next useful feature is the visual display of player inactivity. With some of the upcoming updates, players will be able to identify on the map the bases of users who have not logged into the game for more than the specified number of days. Players will also have the option to filter out bases with inactive players - a cool tool for those looking to plan their next moves.


Our players have been provided with the assistance of our moderators in different socials handles like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram chat. 

We added Christmas decorations to the game.

Also, R-Planet participated in WAX Holidays Calendar
