+ New Product release: Blockchainmon
- https://blockchainmon.io/
- Blockchainmon tracks all guilds infrastructure hourly. The checks we are watching are similar to eosnations producer scorecard. Reg Producer, Organization, Block Production, API Endpoints, P2P Endpoints, bp.json On-Chain, History, Hyperion, Dfuse, Firehose, Atomic Assets, Account, Chain.json. Each guild can receive 1 point per succesful check of the 13 checks done every hour. A guild can receive a maximum of 312 points per day & 2184 points per week. The guilds are tracked via bar graph, at the end of each week the highest scoring guild or guilds(ties are possible) will receieve a gold badge, the second highest guild or guilds will receieve a silver badge and last but not least the third highest scoring guilds will receive a bronze badge. If you are not within the top 3 highest scoring of any given week you will receive no badge. Our intention for Blockchainmon is to increase awareness among guilds and community while rewarding guilds who are supporting WAX with important infrastrcture.
- For our forward looking objectives for BlockchainMon.io: We would like to request that the office of inspector general work with us on this, we would like to use the OIG WAX NFT collection create the Gold, silver & Bronze NFT badges. We believe that BlockchainMon's reward system is aligned with what the OIG stands for, increasing awareness to guilds performance and rewarding guilds who perform well (gold, silver & bronze badges).

We have been getting less traction lately on youtube and decided that since majority of the crypto community is on Twitter that we will transform the way we create and deliver our content. Since twitter now enabled long form video publishing we will post most of our content in video format & article format on twtitter, we will still continue to publish content on youtube but we are going to increase our twitter content while decreasing our youtube content. This month we had some extremely good traction on some of our content where we recieved 5,000+ views and many of the community members are engaging with us & each other in the comments.

Twitter video "WAX wallet major update walk through" in this video we went over the new WAX cloud wallet & also notified developers to update WAX JS library.
