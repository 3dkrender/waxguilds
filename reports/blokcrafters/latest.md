### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

We spent a little time debugging why we were consistently behind on indexed blocks for Hyperion history and
eventually cleared it up by restarting the indexer on a very overloaded system.
It had started too many indexer processes.  We also interacted a bit with ledgerwise to investigate
why the nodestatus page had us perpetually stuck at 57 blocks behind for Hyperion history.
It is now reporting properly for us.

So.. on the latest.md template - it took a bit to figure out that one of the OIG saves the current latest.md.
We're good with this now - and then we just update the latest.md with new info for this reporting period.
