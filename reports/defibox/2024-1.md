https://wax.defibox.io/scoreShop
WAX Lucky Blindbox System 2.0 still on in December, 2023. It is a platform where WAX players can participate some DeFi Game and win rewards on monthly basis. This game gives WAX community lots of fun and also many benefits. WAX players can complete WAX DeFi task, like Swap, adding/reduce liquidity, etc to earn points. Then users can use points to draw blindbox for prize. The task can be customized to suit certain tokens. For example, we can task for WAX-TLM, WAX-AETHER, or WAX-any other project parties tokens so that it is flexible to cooperate with any WAX partner. We have some changes on the game rules, focus on more trading volume while still maintaining points for sign-up, to avoid bots attack while still attracting real users.

2. Chinese-speaking volunteer teams for WAX only
https://t.me/DefiboxCN


Defibox helps a lot in attracting Chinese community to WAX chain with the help of our Blindbox game. New users are new to WAX and there is little Chinese information about WAX. We set up a 10+ Chinese volunteers （WAX中文志愿者）to help those who want to know more about WAX. However, it is the bear market now, users are not that active any more, the Chinese WAX community volunteer team answered 30+ questions for Chinese people who were new to WAX during this month (on average one question per day).
