We have problems over the last few months with high latency in block verification. In order to solve this problem, we optimize our server configuration document and set up more powerful servers. The result has been very good as can be seen in the graph.

After improvement:

After one month running, our server is stable

1. Swap: we have build a swap platform for users. Users can add liquidity to earn transaction fees and mining rewards; they can also buy/sell. We are going to build API and other public support for project teams of WAX to fetch their token price and other info. 

2. Another choice besides Alcor Exchange: Alcor Exchange was the only choice for token trade on WAX. Now comes Defibox. We will bring our proficiency and service to WAX users, giving more choices and DeFi possibilities for WAX.

Alcor focuses more on Book Order Mode. Where you go “Ask” and “Bid”. Sellers offer a price, and buyers accept that price/ vice versa.

Defibox is an automatic market making (AMM). We have “Swap” which is based on Uniswap V2. We build our liquidity for many WAX tokens. In my opinion, it is better than booking orders because there are three major advantages：
a. Swap is realized through smart contracts without manual intervention. 
b. Users can stake tokens for mining and earn transaction fees.
c. The transaction is instant


3. In April, we list USN token (EOS version) on HOO exchange. This is a first step for USN to cross chain between EOS and WAX. In August, we are planning to build USN system on WAX. This is a huge move, because there is no stablecoin with big circulation and good utilities in WAX at the moment. WAX version USN will change the situation. A deep pool with WAX - USN will be set it up. The USN system is similar to MakerDAO system on ETH. This will be another huge project for Defibox besides our WAX version Swap.
