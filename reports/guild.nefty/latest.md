### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

There was an incident related to one of our block producer servers, failover started producing and our monitoring systems reported that the server was unreachable. After several attempts to connect to the server we identified that the server was unreachabled through any network but it was still producing thus resulting in double producing for a small period of time. 
We had to request to forcefuly restart the server.
We are implementing and testing unregbot.
