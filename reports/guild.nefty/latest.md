### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

Last cycle we experienced an issue with the block producer in which a series of faulty items resulted in failure to produce and start failover. The Server presented hardware issues and needed to be replaced. There was also a failure with the Internal network setup resulting in failover not starting when needed, this was also reviewed and solved so failover can work properly. We also added a telegram bot to notify server failures and have people in 3 different timezones that can react to those alerts.
