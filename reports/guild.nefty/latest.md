### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

There was an incident related to storage, disks I/O was irregular and suddenly halting resulting in lost rounds, we had the disks replaced but with a persisten behavior so we requested the host provider to replace the server instead in the end.  
We also had another incident also impacting our BP node related to PCI errors, server was randomly loosing packets and connection, BIOS and firmware were updated to solve this. 
- Upgraded BP to nodeos 5.0.1wax01 and changed to use database_map_mode: mapped_private
- Upgraded part of the public and private nodes to 5.0.1wax01 and changed to use database_map_mode: mapped_private
