## Technical Operations Updates
 
We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.   

We added new USDT/USD and USDC/USD pairs to delphioracle at the WAX Team’s request, and got guilds to approve, test, and push new rates. Currently 25 guilds are pushing the new rates.   

Per the OIG's request, below we are sharing the avg nodeos api HTTP request rate traffic from our load balancers over the last 45 days.   

Total successful /v1/chain requests: 29,843,955   
Total successful /v1/history requests: 37,890   
Total successful /v2/history requests: 1,558,620
