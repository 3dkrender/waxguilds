### Droppp.io

**URLs**: https://droppp.io

**Updates**: 

- We [launched a blog](https://droppp.io/bloggg/) and published an important update regarding upcoming changes to our marketplace wallet structure.   
- Per the wallet changes mentioned above, we have been hard at work desgining and building the frontends and backends necessary to support these changes.   

Stats: - Droppp has created over 206k WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so we believe that most if not all are real accounts (vs bots).
