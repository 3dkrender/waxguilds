**Updates**: 

- New Feature: Drop Moments! Click the Notify Me button on a drop announcement blade to get extra reminders for your fave drops!
- Bug Fix: "Only Show Missing Items" and Rarity Filters in Collection Tracker are back in action.
- Design Update: Updated font sizes on mobile views.
- New Feature: Updated Droppp to incorporate Mythic and Ultra rarities.

Stats: - Droppp has created over 199k WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so we believe that most if not all are real accounts (vs bots).
