### Droppp.io

**URLs**: https://droppp.io

**Updates**: 

- Mobile update: Enjoy a compact preview of an item when buying or listing items from a mobile device (translation: less scrolling!)
- New Feature: Collection Value added to Inventory, Profile, and Drop Collection Overview Pages!
- Bug Fix: Funko Promotional, Bonus, and Mini Drops in the Collection Tracker are back in action!
- Updated shipping notifications: You will now receive a shipping email notification when your package(s) are scanned by the carrier after leaving the warehouse, instead of when the label is created.
- New Feature: Sales History is on Droppp! Now, you can find a rundown of sales history for any item from your inventory, collection tracker or the Droppp Marketplace. Easily view which mints sold, who sold them, and the price paid for each listing.   

Stats: - Droppp has created over 199k WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so we believe that most if not all are real accounts (vs bots).
