### Droppp.io

**URLs**: https://droppp.io

**Updates**: 

- Droppp Marketplace Update: We completed the Droppp Marketplace USDC migration from Circle's custodial wallet service to a self custody solution. With this migration Droppp users in New York, Minnesota, Hawaii, and Alaska can start using Droppp Marketplace.   
- Droppp Marketplace Update: To help users avoid unintentionally purchasing items at unexpected prices, we’ve introduced a new confirmation box on the reservation screen. While users may rarely encounter it, this feature provides a simple way to pause and ensure you’re making the right choice if all listings at a certain price point are gone and the next available option is significantly higher than expected.   

Stats: - Droppp has created over 206k WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so we believe that most if not all are real accounts (vs bots).
