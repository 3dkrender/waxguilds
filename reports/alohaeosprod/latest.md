### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
- We are almost finished creating the custom timeframe reporting on our Benchmarks tool per an OIG request.   
- We have been participating in the Savanna upgrades testing on the Jungle 4 and Kylin testnets. This has introduced changes that broke our reliability tracking of which we have been working on solving. This will be important when and if WAX adopts Savanna.

**Updates**: 

- Card ID: Optimize Your Trading and Selling! Our new Card ID features make managing your inventory easier than ever. You can now search by Card ID within each collection, including the ability to search for multiple Card IDs at once.   
- Misc bug fixes   

Stats: - Droppp has created over 200k WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so we believe that most if not all are real accounts (vs bots).
