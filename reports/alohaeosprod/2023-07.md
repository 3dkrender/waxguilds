## Technical Operations Updates
 
We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.   

We applied the security hotfix to some of our nodes on July 10th, and to the rest of our nodes on July 11th. Our nodes are currently running 3.1.4-hotfix.   

Per the OIG's request, below we are sharing the avg nodeos api HTTP request rate traffic from our load balancers over the last 30 days. In order to provide more detailed statistics we have to make changes to our log retention configurations. We also made the following comment to the OIG on this new request - "This is confusing because your "#" items do not satisfy "how many of the requests query historic data or simply read tables". For example Requests to /v1/* matches both /v1/history/get_actions and /v1/get_table_rows."
