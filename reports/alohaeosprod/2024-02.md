## Technical Operations Updates
 
We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.   

### Updates
- We upgraded all mainnet nodes to Leap-5.0, including our producing nodes.   
- We adjusted our wax.json (and producerjson) with updated node locations and indication of our query endpoints being "full".
- We fixed some bugs with our [WAX Guild Research Portal](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/waxmain), correcting the `WAX` and `WAX/Vote` columns which were off.

### API stats
Per the OIG's request, below we are sharing the approximate nodeos api HTTP request rate traffic from our load balancers over the last 45 days.   

Total successful /v1/chain requests: 88 million   
Total successful /v1/history requests: 114k   
Total successful /v2/history requests: 4.6 million
