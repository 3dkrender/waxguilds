## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

### Atomic Assets API
We have continued offering and maintaining our Atomic Assets API as well as providing history on the testnet for free!

### Hyperion Health Checker
Our Hyperion health checker for haproxy which monitors the last indexed block and number of unindexed blocks, and stops sending requests to it if they exceed the thresholds is still running smoothly. Additionally, we have continued supporting Hyperion for testnet. More information can be found here. - https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio-haproxy

### Light API
Similar to the previous months, the Light API has been running smoothly. EOS Amsterdam is sponsoring a public LightAPI service with full redundancy, high availability, and geo-closest request routing to endpoints in the USA and Europe. More information can be found here - https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio_light_api

### Bdata.io
Bdata is a publicly accessible database with daily statistics on smart contract activity and a full registry of token transfers. EOS Amsterdam is co-sponsoring the infrastructure hosting. More information can be found here - bdata.io

### Chronicle
Chronicle is a software component designed to process the history of an Antelope (formely EOSIO) blockchain. Chronicle release 3.3 is available now on Github. It fixes a floating point overflow bug that broke LightAPI on WAX. EOS Amsterdam has contributed to the software development costs. More information can be found here - https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/eos-chronicle/releases

Furthermore, we made a new snapshot of the Light API here: https://snapshots.eosamsterdam.net/public/lightapi/

### Chronos
Chronos is a history solution for Antelope blockchains. Chronos indexes the transaction traces of an Antelope blockchain in a ScyllaDB database. [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) is an open-source re-implementation of Apache Cassandra database. It's faster because it's implemented in C++, and it supports data sharding.

The database architecture allows for an enormous data ingestion performance. A single server can handle about 100k inserts per second with secondary indexes and materialized views, or even 500k inserts per second without secondary indexes.

The data model of ScyllaDB is that each table or materialized view is a hash of sorted trees: the partition key is an unsortable hash key, and each partition is a sorted tree. Also each tree cannot contain more than 2 billion rows. This implies the limitations and restrictions on the application data model.

This project is a private project by cc32d9. More information can be found here: https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/chronos

### *UPDATE* Memento
Memento is a MariaDB or Postgresql/TimescaleDB database containing transaction traces from an EOSIO blockchain (such as EOS, Telos or WAX), and providing convenient indexes for quick searching. 

A typical use case for Memento is tracking incoming and outgoing payments for a specific account, and checking their reversibility. The database may contain traces for all contracts on the blockchain, or it may be limited to a specific subset of accounts. dApps can set up their own instances, while public infrastructure providers may offer the service to a wider audience.

It can also be accessed through a HTTP API, supporting both MySQL and Postgres backends. Additionally, it also has a GraphQL interface in addition to the RESTful interface.

EOS Amsterdam is cosponsoring the development of a new streaming API in Memento. The new API will allow the user to connect to the websocket endpoint and subscribe to events for multiple blockchain accounts. The wsebsocket service needs to listen on a separate TCP port, so a new environment option is required. socket.io protocol is used for communication. More information can be found here - https://github.com/Antelope-Memento/antelope_memento/issues/1

EOS Amsterdam sponsored the product development and is providing a public endpoint for demo purposes. More information can be found here: https://github.com/Antelope-Memento/antelope_memento

### *UPDATE* Antelope/WAX-leap
Following the latest WAX Leap 5.0.1 release, we have been working on the 5.0.2 release. We are tackling some issues here - https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/2384

EOS Amsterdam is sponsoring the maintenance of WAX-specific version of the Antelope software. More information can be found here - https://github.com/eos-amsterdam-rnd/wax-leap/releases

### Antelope Smart Contract Developer's Handbook
The smart contract developer's handbook aims to address all the questions existing and prospective Antelope smart contract developers might have. This should make developer onboarding even easier. This project is a private project by cc32d9. The handbook can be found here: https://cc32d9.gitbook.io/antelope-smart-contract-developers-handbook/

### Exposition Park Holdings (wax.io)
cc32d9 has continued providing both consultancy and infrastructure to Exposition Park Holdings, the core team behind WAX.

### bInfra.one
bInfra.one is an infrastucture service for dApps to offer them stronger and more reliable infrastructure. This service has helped various popular applications with their infrastructure so far. Some of the notable clients include milliononmars.com, desertfarm.io, and arenaofglory.io. This service is offered by cc32d9.

### Community support
Cc32d9 has been helping many community members in the various WAX and Antelope community channels on Telegram.

### *UPDATED* Usage statistics
In addition to our regular updates we also want to provide usage statistics for our APIs, history solutions and p2p connections. They are as follows:
WAX RPC: 286k API requests per hour on average
Light API: 128k requests per hour on average, with 96% of the requests coming from WAX
Atomic Assets API: 34k requests per hour on average
WAX Hyperion: 8k history requests per hour on average

### Other
Some other points worth mentioning:
* We have continued participating in a collaboration group between WAX, Telos, EOS, and other Antelope chains.
