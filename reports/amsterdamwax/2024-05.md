### Chronos

**URLs**: [https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/chronos](https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/chronos)

**Description**: Chronos is a history solution for Antelope blockchains. Chronos indexes the transaction traces of an Antelope blockchain in a ScyllaDB database. ScyllaDB is an open-source re-implementation of Apache Cassandra database. It's faster because it's implemented in C++, and it supports data sharding.

The database architecture allows for an enormous data ingestion performance. A single server can handle about 100k inserts per second with secondary indexes and materialized views, or even 500k inserts per second without secondary indexes.

The data model of ScyllaDB is that each table or materialized view is a hash of sorted trees: the partition key is an unsortable hash key, and each partition is a sorted tree. Also each tree cannot contain more than 2 billion rows. This implies the limitations and restrictions on the application data model.

This project is a private project by cc32d9.

### Memento

**URLs**: [https://github.com/Antelope-Memento/antelope_memento](https://github.com/Antelope-Memento/antelope_memento)

**Description**: Memento is a MariaDB or Postgresql/TimescaleDB database containing transaction traces from an EOSIO blockchain (such as EOS, Telos or WAX), and providing convenient indexes for quick searching.

A typical use case for Memento is tracking incoming and outgoing payments for a specific account, and checking their reversibility. The database may contain traces for all contracts on the blockchain, or it may be limited to a specific subset of accounts. dApps can set up their own instances, while public infrastructure providers may offer the service to a wider audience.

It can also be accessed through a HTTP API, supporting both MySQL and Postgres backends. Additionally, it also has a GraphQL interface in addition to the RESTful interface.

EOS Amsterdam is cosponsoring the development of a new streaming API in Memento. The new API will allow the user to connect to the websocket endpoint and subscribe to events for multiple blockchain accounts. The wsebsocket service needs to listen on a separate TCP port, so a new environment option is required. socket.io protocol is used for communication.
