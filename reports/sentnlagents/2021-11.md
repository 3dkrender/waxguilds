## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- We have started installing a new Hyperion sevice running on th latest version
- Our current hyperion solution has been configured to now alos allow streaming.
- We created a python script to automate finding and re-indexing any missing block on Hyperion. The tool has been merged into Hyperion -

### 1. Security Audits

We continue to perform security audits for Guilds on the WAX mainchain. I wanted to take some time to list all the checks we perform, as I think this service is sometimes undervalued. Presently the scanning of a single guild takes 2 weeks to complete. Here is a list of each of our checks and whaty they are performed:

- Domain scan to identify unknown subdomains. Each DNS record created, used or unused can be discovered and this very often reveals hidden services running that are not entirely secured.
- Nmap scan of all ports and services attached. We perform a full TCP & UDP scan of all ports (0-65535) and try and identify the version of the software running behind the port. Once we extrapolate the version we can then feed that into multiple public exploit databases to identify any known exploits. We use both automated (nuclei) and manual checks. We are also a contributor to Nuclei - https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/graphs/contributors
- OWASP top 10 scan on all web services. OWASP 10 is contiously updated list that represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. 
- SSH audit to identify any known issues on the versions of OpenSSH in use.
- SSL/TLS audit on HTTPS. We check certifcates and certificate chains for any comprised upstream certificates and or outdated versions of TLS in use.
- Browsing website using Burp (https://portswigger.net). Burp is a hackers swiss army knife, which we use to perform all kinds of checks on Guild websites. It also helps us manual verify any of our findings.
- Brute force directory scanning for any hidden urls and or files. This check allows us to identify any hidden files of folders running on web servers that may reveal any sensitive information. 
- Github clone of all repos checking for secrets. Occasionally important secrets are mistakingly uploaded to github that should knot be known to the public. We utlise two tools, trufflehog & gitDorker to scan the guilds Git repositories for any of these secrets. To ensute maximu coverage these tools scan all of the github history.
- Javascript vuln scan on websites, to identify known exploits of any JS libraries in use on public facing sites, this includes scanning atomic and hyperion JS libraries.
- Checking email addresses of organization against any known password/username dumps. This is a crucial step as some guilds have been running an outdated version of OpenSSH, which allows usersnames to be identified. Combine that with a leaked email address and password combination, you know have a very easy path to bruteforce your way into the servers hosted by a guild.

It is of the upmost importance our Guilds are secure as they are the gatekeepers to the entire blockchain. I wrote a article last year explaining the importance of guild security.

We hope the OIG will consider awarding this service more points as it really is a very proffesional service we provide that we feel is of upmost importance to the WAX network.

*  We completed the audit for Blacklusion this month. 



### 2. Automated Guild Rating system

#### Frontend

This project was created to help the OIG move away from Notion. We are proud to finally release the beta version of the software.
We invite the OIG to start using it and provide further feedback so we can adapt the product to your needs.

During our last meeting we discuss the ability to take a overall snapshot of the guild standings, which is now functional.

The way back machine function (Timemachine) as we call it, allows the OIG to take a snapshot of all guilds and all of their current information and scores, to allow a way to walkback to the past.

Here is a list of Frontend Pull requests that were merged this month.

https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/pull/18 - Implements timemachine functionality and the average monthly result on a per Guild basis. 
https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/pull/19 - Implements a better popup when creating timemachine snapshot
https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/pull/20 - Fixes issue with timemachine state being lost.


We are very excited to grow this  product with the OIG.

#### Backend

- This month we added a few more code exceptions to catch guilds that are throwing errors that would otherwise stop the process from running.
- The process now runs every 2 hours.


#### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Currently Guild logos are not showing when viewing scores outside of a timemachine. Resolve the issue
- Averages on per guild page needs to be based on days, which should be configurable by OIG. So instead of showing the averages bast on the last month, based it on days as specified by the OIG.

- Update tech scoring to reflect new scoring.
- Gather further feedback from OIG to implement more changes. 



### 3. WAXRAM 

- We have been working on a RAM site for the WAX community, where users can track the pricing of RAM using tradingview charts. The site has now been released here https://waxram.sentnl.io
- We are also working on providing more statistics to the site.
- We decided to remove the ability to trade RAM due to current issue on the WAX chain with RAM scpeculation.

## Running usefl APIs:

- CVE search service has been upgraded and a cron service has been enabled to ensure updates are perform every 4 hours.
- We also continue to provide the Atomic API service.

## Creation of original informational content or translation that benefits WAX:

- Sentnl Security Wiki  - https://wiki.sentnl.io

- We have published a article on NFTS here and parterned up with loveretro facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/loveretrouk/) with 26K users to publish a monthly NFT article to help attract new WAX users. The facebook group is all about retro games and arcade machines.

The article has been published on medium and the loveretrouk facebook group

https://medium.com/@charles.holtzkampf/wax-digital-brings-out-tmnt-funko-74c455eb6e44

- We also decided to spend more time investigating new NFT ranges being published on WAX and wrote a article on the Mattel - Hot Wheels launch.

We have posted our monthly update to Medium and tweeted our update to all our followers, here is the link:

## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshots.sentnl.io
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshot-service

* EOS monitor - We created a EOS node monitoring tool that monitors your nodeos and elerts if if there any issues.
https://github.com/ankh2054/eosmonitor

* Hyperion missing blocks feature (NEW RELEASE) - A script that automates finding missing blocks in hyperion.
https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/tree/v3.3.5/scripts/fix_missing_blocks
