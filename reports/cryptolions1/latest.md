Since Q2 2024,  the new Antelope Software was tested on specialized Jungle instances/copies that were setup and maintained by CryptoLions team. We have been working closely with the development team, perform test scenarios and collaborating with several dedicated Block Producers to test Antelope Software, that potentially can revolutionize the WAX blockchain in the future. 

Note: It was not clear if we can reveal this during previous OIG reports, now it is not a secret anymore, so we can revial this.
