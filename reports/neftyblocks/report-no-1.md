## Announcing our NeftyBlocks Guild Candidacy

## Introduction

NeftyBlocks is a WAX-based NFT platform founded in April 2021 with a passion for empowering NFT enthusiasts around the world. To reach the masses, NFTs should be made simple. When struggling ourselves with creating amazing NFT drops on the WAX Blockchain, we set out to build convenient tools and services for the WAX community to use. Ever since, we are working closely with the community of creators and collectors of WAX to find opportunities to add value to the ecosystem.

Today, we want to continue building on this foundation. At NeftyBlocks we are proud to announce our Guild candidacy on the Worldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) Blockchain.

### Technical Operations

Our experience setting up and maintaining the infrastructure required to run NeftyBlocks fills us with confidence that we can become a reliable block producer on the WAX Blockchain. Learning from the experience of block producers in the space, we aim to raise the bar of infrastructure used to reliably produce blocks on WAX. 
For the test network we choose servers with CPU optimized for single threaded operations and enough resources to handle the current main net workload. 


**Testnet equipment:**
3 x TestNet servers with the following specifications:
-  CPU AMD Ryzen™ 9 5950X 
-  RAM 128 GB DDR4 ECC 
-  Disk NVMe SSD 2 x 3.84 TB

**Setup**
1 x Block producer
1 x chain API host
1 x Atomic API (Coming soon)


For mainnet, due to the higher RAM requirements that are part of the new requirements, we decided to use servers with high-end single thread operations performance and enough RAM to exceed the requirements. We are confident that this setup will be sufficient for the first months and monitor its performance closely.

**MainNet equipment:**
5 x MainNet servers with the following specifications:
- Intel® Xeon® W-2295 RAM
- 320GB DDR4 ECC 
- 2 x 3.84 TB NVMe SSD Datacenter Edition

**Setup**
1 x Block producer
1 x Backup producer
2 x seed nodes and chain API host
1 x Atomic API (Coming soon)

Aside from the equipment used to produce blocks on WAX, we have many more servers in use to support the NeftyBlocks day to day operations. As a guild on the WAX Blockchain, we aim to complement the value we add through the NeftyBlocks platform with continued operational value for the WAX Blockchain.

### Product Development

Since April 2021, we have been fully dedicated to building the NeftyBlocks platform (neftyblocks.com). The NeftyBlocks platform provides convenient tools for creators and collectors to buy, sell and distribute NFTs. Over the past 9 months, we have focussed our development effort on two distinct product categories; Creators and Collectors. 

**Creators**
Being able to sell drops is key to the success of creators. Understanding this, NeftyBlocks provides an easy-to-use UI for creators to sell their packs and NFTs. To deliver on our objective of empowering creators to amaze their communities, we have created a suite of self-service tools that can be accessed through the NeftyBlocks platform or by interacting directly with our publicly available smart contracts. We offer 5 products in this category, all available on the NeftyBlocks platform or by use of the publicly available smart contracts.
