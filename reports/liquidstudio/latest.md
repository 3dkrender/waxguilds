### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We currently still provide partail History (blocks.log, state_history.log etc.) while providing full Hyperion. Our History-Nodes (blocks.log, state_history.log etc.) are close to beeing fully synched (only a few M blocks missing) and we will soon provide full History again. Full History will likely be offered before the next full evaluation so it might has an influence on one of the next tech ratings already.

Firehose is also close to beeing fully synched (only a few M blocks missing) and we will soon provide the Firehose service. The service will likely be offered before the next full evaluation so it might has an influence on one of the next tech ratings already.

We updated our Atomic Services within the 09/10/11 of April and had some downtime of this service due to restoring the database from a backup provided by EOSphere.

###### Unity3D
We have some time into the possibilities of a Unity3D integration, but unfortunately a simple and developer-friendly Unity3D integration is currently not possible because .NET packages supported by Unity are now deprecated and Unity does not yet support new packages based on .NET 8. Unity has announced .NET 8 support and is actively working on this. 

As soon as .NET 8 is supported, the required packages and therefore FirehoseSharp will also be supported in Unity. Developers who want to use Firehose in Unity will have to resort to individual solutions using [Unity Asset Store - BestHttp](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/best-http-267636) for the time being, but can use our implementation as an example.
