## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- unfortunately we had major issues with our History/Hyperion/Atomic/Chain-API leading into several days of downtime of most of our infrastructure excluding testnet and Block Producers.
  - it seems like our SHiP Nodes broke, resulting in serving corrupt data via websocket which then lead into corrupt data being consumed by Hyperion and the AtomicAssets API
  - we now seize the moment to completely restructuring our Infrastructure, replace nodes, upgrade etc.
- firehose is still replaying
