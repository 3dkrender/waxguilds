## What is the name of your Guild?

liquidstudio - LiquidStudios (rebranding to liquiid.io)

(Blog-Post November can be found here: )

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
As always, we are proud to say that we still havn't missed a single Block on Mainnet (except for one planned outage to test fallbacks when we first got into top 21). 

We again upgraded some of our nodes to keep up with the high traffic and storage needed and are currently adding additional nodes. Also, all our nodes are running on machines with at least 128GB RAM to be able to support the RAM-inflation upgrade in the best way.

There was a problem with missing blocks on our API when the pre-tech-evaluation happened, which is now fixed.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

### Pomelo

We also created a grant on pomelo and will receive some funding through it with the goal to create "the liquiid bible", a single platform for Game Developers, full of educational content like tutorials and examples on both, smart contract development and integrations to give every game developer out there an easy to use guide from start to finish and to allow any developer to build games on EOSIO-based chains.

We developed and published new Repositories and Tools on our Github.
### [DfuseGraphQlSubscriptionClient](https://github.com/liquidstudios/dfusegraphqlsubscriptionclient)
One of our flagships, a Dfuse Client Library to subscribe to and consume dfuse-notifications via graphiql, it enables developers to consume actions and table-deltas with the lowest possible delay and enables them to build the best user-experiences possible, compatible with Unity3D (all different platforms) and traditional C# and .NET. Examples and installation-instructions coming in the next weeks (there are some third-party libraries for multi-platform-compatability needed).

### [DfuseGraphQlClient](https://github.com/liquidstudios/dfusegraphqlclient) 
A simple Dfuse Client Library to query data via dfuse's graphql-endpoints (no subscriptions), compatible with Unity3D (all different platforms) and traditional C# and .NET. Examples and installation-instructions coming in the next weeks (there are some third-party libraries for multi-platform-compatability needed). Note: due to the third-party libraries needed by the plugin above and the way Unity compiles projects, these two plugins are split into separate ones to reduce build-sizes.

### [AtomicMarketApiClient](https://github.com/liquidstudios/atomicmarketapiclient)
A ApiClient for the AtomicMarketAPI based on the new pattern (Factory-Pattern + ParameterBuilder) due to the large amount of parameters and endpoints the AtomicMarketsAPI. As always fully compatible with Unity3D and traditional C# and .NET, all tests passing, examples provided. 


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We are as always very active in various channels and advise various projects and developers and are ready with individual assistance, especially in the field of game development. 

In addition we represented the WAX community and WAX publicly at the following events, as well as promoted and showcased LiquiidUniverse and our SDKs and the development on EOSIO-based chains.
