**Update:**

TVL: $287,458.63 (8,679,238.4134 WAX)

**New Feature:**

-We’ve teamed up with the Thrive on Mars team to integrate LSW into their Operator Program, renting LSW CPU power to the game.

-This collaboration aims to use $MARTIA rewards to incentivize LSW staking further and create more farms that add value to the WAX ecosystem.

-CPU usage remains stable at 50-70% of total capacity, ensuring enough resources are available for normal deposit and withdrawal requests.

-Pending Announcement: The Operator Program has been running since the start of the month.

### Inter Blockchain Communication

The recent EOS upgrade to Spring 1.0 has temporarily disabled IBC from EOS to any chain. Alcor has been actively addressing the situation and communicating with the relevant teams. Here's what we've done so far:

-Established ongoing communication with the ENF, WAX team, and the IBC team to seek solutions.

-Removed IBC bridging UI for EOS to any chain to avoid user confusion.

-Provided direct communication with users, giving early warnings one month prior to the EOS upgrade regarding potential disruptions to the IBC protocol.

-We’ll continue working on this matter and keep the community informed of any updates.

### <ins>Feedback to OIG</ins>
*We respectfully disagree with the decision to assign a minimum decay rate of 0 points to Liquid Staked WAX (LSW). LSW is the first liquid staked token on the WAX blockchain, representing a significant advancement for the community. The protocol has undergone extensive audits by Sentinl to ensure its security and integrity, with audit costs exceeding $5,000 USD. Notably, there are no fees charged by the Alcor team for utilizing this protocol.

With over 8 million WAX staked through LSW, it is clear that this protocol has earned the trust of the community. LSW remains a work in progress, and its continuous development aims to further benefit the WAX ecosystem. To apply a decay rate that reduces its contribution to zero does not accurately reflect its importance and value to the network. We believe LSW's positive impact should be recognized and evaluated accordingly.
