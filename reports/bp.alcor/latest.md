### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

Transactions used significantly more CPU on the Alcor Block Producer compared to other BPs. 

For Example, the minting on contract federation transaction took about 3-10ms on Alcor (https://wax.bloks.io/transaction/0da348a78dbd6fea6888641a8fecaf759de7f3cfc42a0ab60b180dff8c489ba5?tab=traces), while on other BPs it only used 0.5 to 0.7ms. We've upgraded our hardware to address this issue.

### Introducing LSW- Alcor Liquid Staked Token

![image](https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/waxguilds/assets/147891649/fb5becb5-47a3-4aab-8436-9bbc830c5784)



**URLs**: 
https://alcor.exchange/staking/

**Introduction**: 

-Liquid Staked WAX ($LSW) offers a liquid staking solution for WAX. By staking your WAX coins with Alcor DEX, you receive an on-chain representation of your staking position as the $LSW token. This allows you to participate in DeFi activities while maximizing earning WAX DeFi APR rewards.

**LSW compared to individually staking**

Alcor handles voting and restaking on behalf of users, ensuring maximum APR while also providing a Liquid Staked Token that can be used in various DeFi activities, including Spot, farms, and possibly upcoming lending and borrowing.

Wallets participating in the protocol will be taken into account for airdrops from partnered projects and taken into account retroactively in points programs.

Users can withdraw their WAX, subject to a 3-day unbinding period, or swap their $LSW for WAX instantly on Alcor or other listed DEXes for immediate access to their assets.

**Next milestones**

-LSW is available on the main net, silent launch until audit of contract is 100% completed by Sentnl (in progress).

-Introducing Instant and delayed Unstake.
