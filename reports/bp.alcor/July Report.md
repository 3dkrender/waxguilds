### LSW- Alcor Liquid Staked Token

![image](https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/waxguilds/assets/147891649/fb5becb5-47a3-4aab-8436-9bbc830c5784)



**URLs**: 
https://alcor.exchange/staking/

**Update**: 


- There have been a total of 4 airdrops since $LSW launch (KEK, WUFFI and KEK again) we aim to continue attracting new projects to collaborate with our DeFi initiatives, increasing the overall APR of LSW.
- The fifth airdrop is coming this month!


**Metrics**

6.4 Million WAX staked in one month. 

Worth noting: During the latest WAX dip, the LSW protocol successfully handled a withdrawal of over 600,000 WAX without any issues. Remarkably, following this significant dip, the TVL increased to 6.4 million within a few days. This milestone demonstrates the utility and resilience of Liquid Staked WAX. We will continue to leverage this tool to empower the WAX community through our upcoming projects.
