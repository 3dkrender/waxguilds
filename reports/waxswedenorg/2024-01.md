## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
- Thalos has gotten further improvements
	- The repo is public and can be accessed here:
		- https://github.com/eosswedenorg/thalos
	- Thalos NPM Module 
		- https://github.com/eosswedenorg/thalos-nodejs
		- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eosswedenorg/thalos-client
	- Updates on Docs 
		- https://thalos.waxsweden.org/
- Thalos got the first external users testing the software and providing valuable feedback

### APT repo
- built and added the latest WAX releases, including 3.2.5, 4.0.5 and 5.0
	- Had to re-design the build environment for the antelope changes

### WAX Testnet
- Prepared and executed the update of the WAX Testnet contracts
- This process required more work and time than anticipated, but execution was successful.
	- Deployed contract updates
		- https://testnet.waxblock.io/transaction/8bd6b83bd922ca580e5ab5acf73adf5fc4aab0cbd44ca8cb69868eb94185eaf7
	- Activated powerup on WAX Testnet
		- https://testnet.waxblock.io/transaction/dc1309ab73fa6f721ea56f24b7f654e2ba7ecf1399470515997f095c861a3080
	- Updated Global Parameters
		- https://testnet.waxblock.io/transaction/d5c0843e931674852b30f9b63528e00453ae193a02a0e2843a3ae61d985ca070
	- Tested the features to ensure they work

To try the powerup feature, the transaction format is:
- *push action eosio powerup '["waxswedenorg","waxswedenorg", 1, 1000000000, 1000000000, "10.00000000 WAX"]'*
The '1000000000' is the fraction of CPU and NET. The User Interfaces will have to handle buying the correct amount for users.
For this, I've requested that formula so that it can be written down and explained in an upcoming blog post.
