### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We had several Hyperion downtimes caused by the failed synchronization with the SHiP node which was running wax-leap v4.0.4. We had to manually resynchronise the missing history.
After these events, we decided to upgrade SHiP node to wax-leap 5.0.1, and it was a great choice so far as it seems that now Hyperion synchronizes successfully without any downtime for the last couple of weeks. 
We keep monitoring it to make sure we offer the best possible uptime.
