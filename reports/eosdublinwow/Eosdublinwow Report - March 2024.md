##### 2. Antelope Java SDK

We took the responsibility to bring back and update the Java SDK libraries originated from block.one. 

First version, reshaped and aligned with Antelope, is already released (and used in production).

We are currently working to have the next releases under the official antelope.io namespace. Further work is needed to fully update the abieos serialization provider and to release a windows compatible version of the library (right now we only support Linux and macOS).

Libraries:

- Antelope Java SDK [https://github.com/mcicu/antelope-java-sdk](https://github.com/mcicu/antelope-java-sdk) (main library)
- Softkey signature provider [https://github.com/mcicu/antelope-java-softkey-signature-provider](https://github.com/mcicu/antelope-java-softkey-signature-provider) 
- RPC provider [https://github.com/mcicu/antelope-java-rpc-provider](https://github.com/mcicu/antelope-java-rpc-provider)
- ABIEOS serialization provider [https://github.com/mcicu/antelope-java-abieos-serialization-provider](https://github.com/mcicu/antelope-java-abieos-serialization-provider)
