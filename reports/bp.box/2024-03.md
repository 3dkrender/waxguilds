Initiative C:  Building an educational platform for WAX
Defibox has a very strong community on EOS. We are planning to build an educational website about WAX, so that EOS users can learn more about WAX and join the WAX family. Before we take a big move, we would like to try on Gitbook first, see the feedback from the communities. This is an example of Gitbook articles on a weekly basis: https://defibox-team.gitbook.io/defibox/v/fan-ti/guan-yu-wax/wax-sheng-tai-zi-xun/alien-world-wai-xing-shi-jie
