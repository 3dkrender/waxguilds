Initiative B:  Building a Chinese WAX communities with 250+ real users on Wechat; rebuild telegram teams with 20+ WAX volunteers 


Initiative C:  Building an educational platform for WAX
Defibox has a very strong community on EOS. We are planning to build an educational website about WAX, so that EOS users can learn more about WAX and join the WAX family. Before we take a big move, we would like to try on Gitbook first, see the feedback from the communities. This is an example of Gitbook articles on a weekly basis: https://defibox-team.gitbook.io/defibox/v/fan-ti/guan-yu-wax/wax-sheng-tai-zi-xun/alien-world-wai-xing-shi-jie

What is the name of your Guild?

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
EOS <--> WAX cross-chain IBC bridge
 



1) What problem resolves?
Defibox is the only leading DeFi on EOS covering over 5,000 Chinese, Korean, and International users, in which 1,000+ users stay active on a daily basis. Those EOS users always visit the Defibox website for cross-chain between Telos, EOS EVM and other DeFi activities. We would like to add support for EOS WAX cross chain so that EOS users can easily cross chain their assets to WAX and vice versa.
 
2) What are the competitors?
https://alcor.exchange/bridge
Alcor DEX provides exactly the same functions, but Alcor DEX is popular for WAX users, but not very big for EOS users. They don't have an active EOS community. With Defibox's strong EOS community, we can bring lots of EOS users to WAX.



 
3) How will this project be marketed to the EOS and WAX community? What would be the budget for marketing and adoption?
1. We will start with cross-chain event rewards, for people who cross chain EOS-WAX, giving BOX rewards;
2. Liquidity mining for EOS-WAX on both side: Defibox EOS and Defibox wax
https://defibox.io/bridge/
Total budget can be up to 10,000 USD worth of BOX for the long term (6 months), but it depends on numbers of users and assets


 
7) What happens if you stop maintaining this cross-function service?
The function will continue for a long time because the maintenance cost is low. The harder parts are making EOS-WAX mining yield good and trading active; attracting people to use it by good marketing plans. I think a smart and flexible plan will do because things change fast, we are able to adapt changes.
 
8) What metrics will be used to monitor the success? What are you estimations of metrics for 1, 6 and12 months?
Because the EOS <--> WAX communities are kind of isolated, although both are Antelope systems. We need a sustainable plan to make it work. As long as 10% of EOS users decide to join WAX and have a look, I would say 100 - 200 daily active users using our cross-chain bridge would be seen as a success.





WAX Lucky Blindbox System 2.0


https://wax.defibox.io/scoreShop WAX Lucky Blindbox System 2.0 is a platform where WAX players can participate in some DeFi Game and win rewards on a monthly basis. This game gives the WAX community lots of fun and also many benefits. WAX players can complete WAX DeFi tasks, like Swap, adding/reduce liquidity, etc to earn points. Then users can use points to draw blindbox for prizes. The task can be customized to suit certain tokens. For example, we can task for WAX-TLM, WAX-AETHER, or WAX-any other project party tokens so that it is flexible to cooperate with any WAX partner. We have some changes on the game rules, focusing on more trading volume while still maintaining points for sign-up, to avoid bots attack while still attracting real users.

Defibox WAX
Swap supported with dual mining, price line, data chart, etc. https://wax.defibox.io/ we have build a swap platform for users. Users can add liquidity to earn transaction fees and mining rewards; they can also buy/sell and get tokens instantly. We provide mining tools that can give liquidity provider rewards with various tokens (WAX, BOX, and project team tokens). In this way, liquidity of trade pairs will be easily boosted and this increases TVL level of WAX, thus improving its overall value of WAX chain. Smart contract that executes dual mining.

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development? 
We are planning to add a WAX Educational Website, so that our EOS players can know more about WAX and potentially invite EOS users to WAX. We are going to firstly build our Gitbook WAX for a trial. Later on, we will expand to our all the media platform, like Youtube, Medium, Twitter, educating people about WAX
https://defibox-team.gitbook.io/defibox/v/fan-ti/guan-yu-wax/wax-sheng-tai-zi-xun/alien-world-wai-xing-shi-jie



Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
Lucky BlindBOX 2.0 WAX with 500+ WAX accounts involved due to our bots filter system, the one who participate are real users: WAX on chain record: https://wax.bloks.io/account/ann.box
Chinese-speaking volunteer teams for WAX only https://t.me/DefiboxCN
Wechat Group for WAX only that has 250+ real users 
Defibox helps a lot in attracting the Chinese community to the WAX chain with the help of our Blindbox game. New users are new to WAX and there is little Chinese information about WAX. We set up a 20+ Chinese volunteers （WAX中文志愿者）to help those who want to know more about WAX. Also we have a our own BOX wechat group of 264+ real users for serving Defibox WAX. (Wechat users are almost 100% real users due to the strict Wechat account control)
