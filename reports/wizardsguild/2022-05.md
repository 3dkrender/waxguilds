A new quest was added to the game bringing the total to 21. It is entitled “Volley of Quarrels” and to complete it, a player must own a [Crossbow NFT](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/niftywizards/27281) and complete the instructions given – get 3 kills without dying using only your crossbow. This can be accomplished in the Battle Training Room.

5 new projects have added the DUST bot to mine DUST rewards while chatting in their room since our last report. Collection mining is being coded which will allow projects to assign DUST reward values to their own NFT’s. The first project to have this functionality will be Nifty Wizards. Three new project DUST Enhancers were released since our last report including Taco, Galactic 123, and NFT Sticker Co. A new 8-bit celebrity parody Enhancer was also released – Stealth Dawg. These enhancers are being offered for multiple currencies including WAX, DUST, TACO, and $NEFTY.
