Our game lobby currently has 3,225 members (down 189 since the last report). Our Twitter account has 4,426 followers (down 28).

Nifty Wizards and DUST share the same Firebase infrastructure. Between the two projects, it was accessed approximately xxxxxx times per day over the last 30 days making the 45-day total approximately xx million.

Two new drops and two new blends are scheduled to begin on March 3rd.

**New Information:**

Nifty Wizards' Castle bot has been upgraded and now reports which NFT's were produced in a given timeframe. Also, a second castle has begun producing NFT's - the Beer Castle. If a player's castle is chosen by the bot, it then verifies the number of Babies owned by that player and mints the coresponding number of Beer NFT's into the player's wallet. Beer NFT's will become deflationary soon with the release of Rare Beer packs and Rare Beer blends.

### **Product 5: DUST**

**Curent Analytics:**

DUST’s all-time NFT sales rank is 91 on the WAX blockchain with $279,713 in sales from 1,605 transactions. DUST’s 30-day sales volume was 2,506 WAX from 9 transactions. Of that 50 WAX was contributed to DEFI. Source: [https:// https://wax.atomichub.io/]( https://wax.atomichub.io/).
