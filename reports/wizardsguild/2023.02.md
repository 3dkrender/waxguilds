**Curent Analytics:** 

Nifty Wizards’ all-time NFT sales rank is 112 on the WAX blockchain with $174,581 in sales from 20,638 transactions. The 30-day sales volume was 14,022 WAX from 257 transactions. Of that, 280 WAX was contributed to DEFI. Source: [https://cryptoslam.io/](https://cryptoslam.io/)

Our game lobby currently has 3,414 members (down 207 since the last report). Our Twitter account has 4,454 followers (down 36).

Nifty Wizards and DUST share the same Firebase infrastructure. Between the two projects, it was accessed approximately 223,000 times per day over the last 30 days making the 45-day total approximately 10 million.

Two new drops and two new blends are scheduled to begin on March 3rd.

**New Information:**

Nifty Wizards' Castle bot has been upgraded and now reports which NFT's were produced in a given timeframe. Also, a second castle has begun producing NFT's - the Beer Castle. If a player's castle is chosen by the bot, it then verifies the number of Babies owned by that player and mints the coresponding number of Beer NFT's into the player's wallet. Beer NFT's will become deflationary soon with the release of Rare Beer packs and Rare Beer blends.

DUST’s all-time NFT sales rank is 91 on the WAX blockchain with $279,538 in sales from 1,605 transactions. DUST’s 30-day sales volume was 605 WAX from 2 transactions. Of that 12 WAX was contributed to DEFI. Source: [https:// https://wax.atomichub.io/]( https://wax.atomichub.io/).
