### **Product 3: NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Current status:** 

Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and Wizardsguild it is intended that NiFTyLIFE’s points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full.

**Progress:**

- Due to the changing interests of collection makes and users, NFT culture has moved away
from massive pack openings. There has not been a pack break in months. This down time
will be used to move packbreaks to chainflex.io in order to provide a central place where
users can discover and use the multiple tools we build.

### **Product 4: DUST**

**New Information:**

- DU$TDAO token mining continues to evolve. The team changes the stakeable assets each month to give all users a fair opportunity at mining DUSTDAO tokens. Nifty Wizards NFT's, DUST NFT's and DU$T Tokens are all stakeable for mining DUSTDAO governance tokens. Nifty Wizards NFT staking can be done [here](https://waxdao.io/farm/niftydaofarm). DU$T NFT staking can be done [here](https://waxdao.io/farm/dustnftfarm). 

- DU$T Staking to mine DU$TDAO tokens continues to gain attention on two platforms - [Alcor Exchange](https://alcor.exchange/swap?input=DUST-niftywizards&output=DUSTDAO-dao.dust) and [Taco Swap](https://swap.tacocrypto.io/swap?output=DUSTDAO-dao.dust&input=DUST-niftywizards)

- DU$TDAO token staking is now live[here](https://waxdao.io/pool/dustdao). Staked DU$TDAO tokens mine additional DU$TDAO tokens.
