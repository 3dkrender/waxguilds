### **Product 3: NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Current status:** 

Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and Wizardsguild it is intended that NiFTyLIFE’s points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full.

**Progress:**

- Due to the changing interests of collection makes and users, NFT culture has moved away
from massive pack openings. There has not been a pack break in months. This down time
will be used to move packbreaks to chainflex.io in order to provide a central place where
users can discover and use the multiple tools we build.

### **Product 4: DUST**
