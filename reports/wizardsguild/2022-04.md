* On April 2nd, 2022 Nifty Wizards held their first “Mini Battle Royale” where anyone with the required NFT’s in their WAX wallet were able to participate in a text-based battle to the death. The plan is to hold a Mini BR monthly and then bigger battles quarterly. The prizes for this battle were generously donated by a player. In total, 34 players registered and 21 showed up to play. A full description of the battle can be found here: [https://link.medium.com/enWbqoHiUob](https://link.medium.com/enWbqoHiUob).

The Goblin Bot mentioned in last months report is getting closer to being released into the game. The dev’s have added three different animations for when the goblin is killed, and if the rare animation is displayed, a rare Goblin Head NFT will be automatically sent to the player’s synced wallet. If it is not displayed, a non-transferable NFT will be sent to acknowledge the accomplishment along with a random Nifty Wizards NFT.

**Project 3: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current Status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Waxstash’s product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Both waxstash.com and waxstash.io are currently live, but separate, marketplaces. With waxstash.com supporting TLM and DUST sales, while waxstash.io provides more features but currently only supports WAXP.

**Progress:**
As planned waxstash.io was launched on schedule and presents several new features made possible by the Atomicassets standard and some unique features that are exclusive to waxstash. Notable features include:
•	Filters covering nearly every NFT schema/template/asset trait for each verified and whitelisted collection. For example, in regards to bcbrawlers Atomichub presents filters for Schema, Rarity, Variant, and CardId….whereas Waxstash presents Schema, Rarity, Variant, Champion, Hometown, Match Slots, and Packs, with each filter containing all the possible options for it that exist within a given collection.
•	Selected filters present “Chips” along with search results. Chips are analogous to breadcrumbs with each chip representing one of the selected filter options. Each chip presents the user with information regarding which filters are chosen and each chip can be clicked on to quickly remove that option and reload new search results.
•	Full NFT Marketplace, for listings, auctions, and history each independently searchable via the aforementioned filters.
•	NFT Explorer for collections, templates, and assets each independently searchable via the aforementioned filters.
•	NFT User Profile presenting a users inventory, current listings, current auctions, and sale history each independently searchable via the aforementioned filters.
•	Bulk tools for creating or managing up to 40 items at a time. Create 40 separate listings, auctions, or bundled assets in seconds, in WAX or pinned to USD. Users can also bulk edit up to 40 current listings at a time, with UI options to change the price or cancel each item in one transaction.
•	Transfer and Token view. A fast and convenient way to transfer NFTs independently or in bulk, and UI presenting an accounts owned tokens for transfer. Updates every 30 seconds.
•	An API picker that presents a notification to users if a slow or unresponsive API is detected along with UI displaying 8 default Atomic APIs and 8 default RPC APIs. along with each APIs current status, version, and speed. Users can select one of the default APIs that works best for them, or they can dynamically enter the URL of any API they wish to use, which will be added to the default API lists.
•	Navigation regarding the above features is managed independently behind the scenes for a faster and more fluid UX. For example, if setting filters and loading ‘Listings’ on the marketplace, and then switching to inventory and setting filters and loading ‘Inventory’ there, the status of each filter and result set is separate. So if user then switches back to ‘Listings’ the previous filters and ‘Listing’ results load instantly, and so on when switching back to ‘Inventory’ or any other feature, like auctions, history, or current listings.

**Next Milestones:**
•	Drops feature module. This will allow users to view, search, claim and but current Atomic and Neftyblocks drops, as well as present a UI for creating Waxstash drops.
•	NFT Creator module. UI for creating NFTs on the Atomicassets standard.
•	Customizable User Profile module.
•	Project banners/ads module.
•	All resized NFT images located on a worldwide CDN.

**User Metrics:**
•	Waxstash.io and .com account for 804 Atomicassets sales across 330 unique users. Total sales volume of 34012.07623102 WAXP and 680 WAX contributed to DEFI.
•	Waxstash.com non-atomicassets sales volume was roughly 15,000 WAX for a total DEFI contribution of about 300 WAX.

**Community Tools**

1. Collectabot is used daily by players of Nifty Wizards and collectors of DUST Enhancer NFT’s. It was queried over 2.8 million times this month. Other projects have recognized the value of such a tool and have developed their own bots with similar functionality

2. Nifty Cap – This site displays WAX NFT collection rankings by sales volume and is refreshed every 24 hours. The goal of the site is to provide more precise figures for WAX collections than sites that combine all NFT projects across many different blockchains.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

Not currently. Thank you for the continued effort and improvements to the system.
