_**Spec Document:**_ A **CONFIDENTIAL** Game Development Document will be provided separate from this report. It is entitled &quot;Game Development Document 10&quot;.

_**New Information:**_ 

* On April 2nd, 2022 Nifty Wizards held their first “Mini Battle Royale” where anyone with the required NFT’s in their WAX wallet were able to participate in a text-based battle to the death. The plan is to hold a Mini BR monthly and then bigger battles quarterly. The prizes for this battle were generously donated by a player. In total, 34 players registered and 21 showed up to play. A full description of the battle can be found here: [https://link.medium.com/enWbqoHiUob](https://link.medium.com/enWbqoHiUob).  And a rundown of the battle including detailed statistics can be found here: [https://link.medium.com/KbWQpiV1Vob](https://link.medium.com/KbWQpiV1Vob). 

The Goblin Bot mentioned in last months report is getting closer to being released into the game. The dev’s have added three different animations for when the goblin is killed, and if the rare animation is displayed, a rare Goblin Head NFT will be automatically sent to the player’s synced wallet. If it is not displayed, a non-transferable NFT will be sent to acknowledge the accomplishment along with a random Nifty Wizards NFT.

_Figure 8 - DUST 2022 Milestone Schedule_

_**New Information:**_ 
* 5 new projects have added the DUST bot to mine DUST rewards while chatting in their room.

* Collection mining is being coded which will allow projects to assign DUST reward values to their own NFT’s. The first project to have this functionality will be Nifty Wizards, and our goal is to have this functionality released in March 2022.

**Project 3: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current Status:**

Pursuant to the merger between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Waxstash be rated, and the full product points be awarded to Wizardsguild.

Waxstash.com is currently active but is being planned to be retired to make room for Waxstash.io. Our current market has received minimal support and marketing as we are focusing all our build time on the new marketplace and its supporting tools, like fully on-chain ﬁlters for every Atomicassets NFT, full-size and resized backups of every NFT image.

**Progress:**

We expect Waxstash.io to be launched prior to the next guild report. Progress towards completion since the last report will be broken up into modules and details below.

* Landing Page Module. 90% progress. UI focused module featuring a slider exhibiting recent top collections, WAX volume and blockchain data, and a panel displaying the most recent listings from the top collections.

* Inventory Module. 90% progress. Displays a user’s proﬁle page, with their assets, collections, and all ﬁlters in the same way the Marketplace Module does, except tailored for what a user does with inventory.

* Bulk Tools Module. 80% progress. A smart module where users can quickly select multiple NFTs and choose to list them as a bundle, or separately but within the same transaction. Along with full NFT data such as lowest listed sales and price autoﬁll options.

* Sale Module. 90% progress. Current listings can be viewed in and dynamically linked to this module. All NFT metadata is available here including front & back images or videos, sale data, pricing and comparisons with other similar sales, and the lowest listed sale for the viewed NFT. From here users can purchase, cancel, or edit a sale.

* Dialogs Module. 50% progress. Sets of popup modules where users manage transactions they want to call.

* Live Auctions Module. 20% progress.

* Users Listings Module. 0% progress.

*	Users Auctions Module. 0% progress.

* History Module. 0% progress.

* Marketplace Module. Complete. This is a core module of the entire app for marketplace functionality. It contains other modules like a Filters Module and Dialog Module and is fully functioning to display sales, collections, ﬁlters, sort options, and ﬁlter chips that can be closed to quickly remove a ﬁlter and reload search results.

* Details Module. Complete. Supports other modules displaying NFT metadata.

* The following modules have been completed: Authentication Module, Collections Module, Default Collection Module, Material Module.

* Every image and video for every whitelisted/veriﬁed NFT has been resized and served on out image server.

**Next Milestones:**
 
* Launch Waxstash.io before the next Guild report.

* The previous milestone to create an API serving ﬁlters for every NFT trait has been altered. This will reside in tables on-chain. The model has been built; within the upcoming week we will push ﬁlters for every NFT trait for every whitelisted/veriﬁed collection. This way it will be available for waxstash and other projects or marketplaces to implement our robust smart ﬁlters.

* A public storage box holding a backup each NFT image from whitelisted/veriﬁed collections.

* A user metrics URL and or user interface, perhaps built into the waxstash.io landing page.

**User Metrics:**

* Estimated that between wax.stash contract and Atomicmarket contract sales less than 100 WAX was contributed to deﬁ.

* Activity nominal otherwise.

* We ﬁxed our Dapp Radar tracking, however it now reads 40 users and $6.7k volume for the last 30 days, which is inaccurate.

* At the time of this writing APIs to trace the history for more accurate metrics are returning errors. We attempted 5 RPC history endpoints and 8 Atomic API endpoints, all responded with either a timeout, a maintenance message, or an error. We will continue to attempt the trace data and submit it on appeal.

**Project 4:NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Progress:**

* As planned since the last report we held one giveaway to bring more attention to repacks. We gave away 350 WAX to the top 3 slot buyers using our on-chain leaderboard tables. The giveaway brought some activity, but it was limited.

* As planned, we listed a repack containing a redeemable Iron Maiden Funko token, grails, and legendary NFTs.

* Several bugs were discovered and ﬁxed.

**Next Milestones**

* During this cycle we will list at least one repack containing top NFTs and will market that out through social media posts.

* During this cycle we will hold at least one WAX giveaway TBD.

* Explore marketing & strategies to help users create valuable repacks that entice users to buy slots. We believe this is the number one reason few repack slots have sold.

* Universal Pack breaker. We have learned that users love packbreaks on newly dropped projects but that after the initial buzz of the new pack dies oﬀ, or most of the packs are opened, the pack breaker for that pack is largely unused. The next update packbreaks will get is a universal pack breaker, so new projects can be supported on the ﬂy, and then turned oﬀ once the buzz dies down, and then the next project drop turned on and so on. The existing pack break contracts would be retired, to make room for packbreaks to be a universal breaker for newly dropped popular packs on one side, and the repack feature on the other. Packbreaks.io just received an update with the repack contract so the universal contract won’t be started at least until the initial version of waxstash.io discussed above is launched.

**User Metrics:**

* Currently 31 Repacks are posted.

* Packbreaks have been silent, and we expect they will be until we implement a universal pack breaker discussed in milestones that can be switched and used for newly dropped and popular packs.

* At the time of this writing APIs to trace the history for more accurate metrics are returning errors. We attempted 5 RPC history endpoints and 8 Atomic API endpoints, all responded with either a timeout, a maintenance message, or an error. We will continue to attempt the trace data and submit it on appeal.

**Project 5: Shyn NFT Portfolio Application**

Shyn (pronounced shine) is an NFT Portfolio application that displays all your WAX AtomicAssets. It can track multiple wallets, calculate total portfolio value, display mint numbers, duplicate assets, and much more. It was recently highlighted by WAX on their official Twitter page: [https://twitter.com/WAX\_io/status/1425849557707943940?s=20](https://twitter.com/WAX_io/status/1425849557707943940?s=20)

**User Metrics:**

On the Apple App Store Shyn had 4,000 impressions, 289 page views, andwas downloaded 101 times in the month of February. Source: appstoreconnect.apple.com.

Medium

* Next blog post following this submission to announce Guild updates and primarily announce Repack features, rules, & giveaways [https://medium.com/@niftylife](https://medium.com/@niftylife) | [https://medium.com/@wizardsguild](https://medium.com/@wizardsguild)

* We published an original technical how-to article about staking WAX and voting for guilds using wax.bloks.io: [https://medium.com/@wizardsguild/how-to-earn-wax-rewards-by-voting-and-staking-your-extra-wax-8cb9db2fc012](https://medium.com/@wizardsguild/how-to-earn-wax-rewards-by-voting-and-staking-your-extra-wax-8cb9db2fc012)


**Community Tools**

1. Collectabot is used daily by players of Nifty Wizards and collectors of DUST Enhancer NFT’s. It was queried over 2.8 million times this month. Other projects have recognized the value of such a tool and have developed their own bots with similar functionality

2. Nifty Cap – This site displays WAX NFT collection rankings by sales volume and is refreshed every 24 hours. The goal of the site is to provide more precise figures for WAX collections than sites that combine all NFT projects across many different blockchains.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

Not currently. Thank you for the continued effort and improvements to the system.
