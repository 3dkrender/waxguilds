_**New Information:**_ 

* On April 2nd, 2022 Nifty Wizards held their first “Mini Battle Royale” where anyone with the required NFT’s in their WAX wallet were able to participate in a text-based battle to the death. The plan is to hold a Mini BR monthly and then bigger battles quarterly. The prizes for this battle were generously donated by a player. In total, 34 players registered and 21 showed up to play. A full description of the battle can be found here: [https://link.medium.com/enWbqoHiUob](https://link.medium.com/enWbqoHiUob).  And a rundown of the battle including detailed statistics can be found here: [https://link.medium.com/KbWQpiV1Vob](https://link.medium.com/KbWQpiV1Vob). 

The Goblin Bot mentioned in last months report is getting closer to being released into the game. The dev’s have added three different animations for when the goblin is killed, and if the rare animation is displayed, a rare Goblin Head NFT will be automatically sent to the player’s synced wallet. If it is not displayed, a non-transferable NFT will be sent to acknowledge the accomplishment along with a random Nifty Wizards NFT.

**Community Tools**

1. Collectabot is used daily by players of Nifty Wizards and collectors of DUST Enhancer NFT’s. It was queried over 2.8 million times this month. Other projects have recognized the value of such a tool and have developed their own bots with similar functionality

2. Nifty Cap – This site displays WAX NFT collection rankings by sales volume and is refreshed every 24 hours. The goal of the site is to provide more precise figures for WAX collections than sites that combine all NFT projects across many different blockchains.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

Not currently. Thank you for the continued effort and improvements to the system.
