#Nodestatus
We have updated nodestatus UI/UX, merged tools and grafana in one.
- made it more user friendly
- Better time-frame filteration for easy view. 
- Easily readable errors. 
- Stats related to health in the form of charts. 

We have also worked on to include Delphi Oracle check (both in form of charts and checks). Hopefully it should be live by Monday. 


##Waxzilla
We have attracted upto 20+ communities. Have been listening to feedbacks and updating the platform regularly. 
Have given an option to sign up with Wombat.
Many gaming guilds have intented to use platform if we could provide them a way to read the transactions and reward their community members,
we will work on it next. 
We have also implemented Pools for automating giveaways on Smart contract. 

We couldn't devote much time to Waxzilla in terms of development as we were busy working with nodestatus. Shall come back to improving Zila from 
nect week.
