- Update Atomic APIs to 1-3-24. Discovered an issue with the template buyoffer refill script which doesn't seem to work anymore now that >90k buyoffers exist. Wrote a manual importer instead. If needed, maybe I can work with the wombat team to fix the importer script.
- Updated Producers and API nodes to WAX 4.0.5
- New Block Producer available
