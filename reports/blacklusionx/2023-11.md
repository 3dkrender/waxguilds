# Blacklusion Nnovember 2023 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**


Quick heads up: I am personally pretty tight on time until about 20. Dec. This has impacted the guild performance (more than I'd like). I am very sorry about that, but this is only a temporary state. We will back to normal very soon. We try our best to keep all of our services up. Besides some issues with the testnet prod, everything was operating normal this month. The devs work as usual and we have a lot of features "finished" but I don't have the time to finalize and deploy them. I'll explain it in detail below.  

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
I think it has been ages since our testnet prod has been regged the last time. It was indeed running the whole time but there were some peering issues. Hence it unregged after some initial issues. It was working fine again once regged. Then recently a power supply failure of a neighbour server killed the fuse and took down the whole rack. We unregged immediately, contacted the data center and resolved the issue asap, but missed a couple of rounnds along the way.

All apis have been stable. As the Atomic Assets issue arised, we deployed a temporary fix as quick as possible.

Over the last 4 weeks:
    - v1/chain: 35,000,000
    - atomic: 750,000 (with our Atomic Api Upgrades we have switched the subdomain aa.wax.blacklusion.io to our main proxy for accurate measuring. This was about a week ago, so we should have accurate measurings next report)
    - total: 35,750,000

### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Released ðŸ¥³
- Link: https://illusive.gg
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - The Web2 account system is more or less finished. Again, I am missing the time to properly migrate to production and deploy
    - We have developed the UI for the token integration. It will show a list and a detailed view of a token. The integration was built with coingecko apis and in order to deploy it an additional integration with alcor.exchange would need to be finished first. We already have deployed the changes to our listing dashboard. Hence newly listed games can already supply the required information.
    - We have deployed a new hero section. The new one looks more professional and makes the platform look busier.
    - We have listed "The Realm", "Outlaw Troopers" and "Spinnia". More games in the pipeline.
    - We fixed the Twitter stat indexing issues
    - We added social indexing for Telegram (not shown in the UI). But this was part of the alien worlds grant deal
    - The alien worlds integration, will go live very soon. Essentially we are building the functionality for alien worlds to showcase all the projects using their nfts. However this is not AW exclusive, which means that e.g. Taco Acryptia and Taco Combz will be linked on illusive, making it easier to discover games and enticing game developers to collaborate
    - As mentioned in the last update we developed the content creation features. They are essentially finished. Since we couldn't deploy them yet, the developers are woking on additional features in the meanwhile. The goal is to offer "normal" and "wiki" articles. The difference being, wiki can be edited by everyone and has an additional navigation.
