# Blacklusion February 2024 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We had a ship just randomly forking non-stop, eventually crashing and corrupting our public atomic assets database. We took this opportunity to rebuild our infrastructure stack. We have ordered 2 new ship servers and discontinued some of our previous ships. We are also in the process of redoing our main API server (still in progress). Once completed all of our main servers should have been replaced within the last 3 months.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - We are actively looking into the pruning. We have started this about 2 weeks ago. Some issues with the other infrastructure came up, postponing this slightly. The main issue currently lies in issues when restoring database dumps of the validationcore database. Before I prune the database, I want to ensure valid dumps exist. However, for some reason, the restoring of the dumps does not work. I know, this shouldn't really be an issue, as we use the same commands (successfully) for our atomic database. We need to conduct some more investigation on this.

### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - Operational. Feel free to DM us @blacklusion to get a demo


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Released
- Link: https://illusive.gg
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - All of the features we have been working on last month have been released and are live ðŸ¥³. Feel free to try our new search with the search widgets, explore "community content creation" allowing users to write content and strategy guides, as well as log in with your web2.0 account and link multiple of your WAX wallets to that account. The latter is especially important with our upcoming multichain rollout. We have also successfully completed our Alien Worlds Grant. As part of the AW grant we have added "Community Pages", that show all games you can play with a specific NFT collection. 
    - We also have started the "big port" of content. With this, we are porting currently existing content to illusive GG (e.g. on the medium of games). This all happens with the approval of the games. The main advantage of the WAX ecosystem lies in having all the content (e.g. how-to guides) on all of the WAX games in a single place. This will make it easier to point users to a site (https://www.illusive.gg/feed/)
    - But this is only the beginning of the features we are working on next. By having the content on our platform, we are able to train our own LLM on it. To get a first working version out ASAP we will probably first rely on the Embeddings API of OpenAI. This will enable us to offer a ChatGPT-style interaction to answer all questions regarding a game.
    - To fuel the content growth on illusive GG, we are working on something we call "Content Pools" introducing a write-to-earn model. We are looking to partner with games to offer a bucket of in-game tokens and reward every contribution after a verification process with X amounts of tokens. This is still in the early stages, but initial feedback from the games was great, as games can cut down on their efforts in maintaining their own wikis and community members get the chance to earn tokens.
    - From now on the content will be our biggest focus, as we believe this adds a truly valuable addition to the ecosystem. This also allows us to expand the platform beyond WAX and even crypto in general, as offering a Gaming consultant at the fingertips of the users is something we are very stoked about getting out there. We will release more information soon, especially in regards to how we are planning to differentiate from existing gaming knowledge bases such as fandom, besides adding the buzzword AI to it. 
    - One thing not directly part of illusive, but linked to it: Our WAX Labs proposal for the NFT Museum. Essentially the scripts are working. We received the 3D models from our partners in Portugal, but I wasn't satisfied with the look. It looked a bit "flimsy". Hence, we decided to just do them in-house instead. This significantly delayed the proposal. We are working on finishing this ASAP. Once finished, we will also integrate this into illusive with a "View in 3D" button. This feature will not be restricted to our platform, as the code will be open source. 
    - With the ongoing changes to the platform, I would like to request a revalidation of the current points we get on this product, not only this month but for the upcoming submissions as well.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
YES - We have submitted this before, but we didn't get any points on this, as it wasn't live yet. But now it is: We have been in the background helping get the Novo War game development off the ground. We have connected Mike Creati from Novopangea with Tiago from Shadowprofile to build the 3D game Novo War. Please reach out if you need more info on this. You can also reach out to Mike and he can confirm this.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
- 

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
YES - I feel like the timelines have been a bit "hard to find" lately. Until about 3 validations, we had a pinned telegram post. Now we still have it, but along different call announcements and the timelines are always appearing about 1-2 weeks later than they used to. I know this is minor. But I honestly "nearly" missed the submissions a couple of times because of this. I recommend creating a Google calendar as requested multiple times before. Add the Google Meet for the calls there and all the relevant timeline information.
