# Blacklusion January 2024 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

All apis have been stable. As the Atomic Assets issue arose, we deployed the temporary fixes ASAP. As issues kept arising with 1.3.24 we did not deploy the changes as of right now. We will update our public apis once a new stable version is released. We also deployed server upgrades in general.
