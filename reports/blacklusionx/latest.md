We still have our WAX labs proposal open about the NFT museum. This month a huge amount of my time was taken up from this, so I'd like to give some more insights on this even though it does not impact our direct scores, but the overall resources spent by our guild. We co-developed it with a gaming studio as our main expertise is not in Unity development. The initial delivery was not on the level of quality I wanted to deliver, hence I stepped in and created new 3D models from scratch (previous months). The Museum has always been "close to finishing" for the past months. However, light-baking (the process of pre-rendering the lighting to ensure good performance on lower-end devices) was a huge hassle. I was really not expecting this to create such issues, however as my typical work setup is a Mac, I had to rent an additional Windows computer and get familiar with the process of baking lights. This was completed as well this month. I also created a new UI for the loading and settings screens. Additionally, there was no proper error handling e.g. when a user inputs a Wallet that does not exist. This was fixed this month as well. Currently, there is still a bug leading to long loading times, which I'd like to fix before claiming WAX labs funds. I apologize for the general long time on the WAX labs proposal and it is unfortunate, that it delayed some development on our other products this month, but I hope the IGs appreciate our efforts to deliver a high-quality WAX Labs product. I am happy to supply more screenshots/progress if required.

Additionally, this month I had the "pleasure" of declaring our taxes, taking up a major part of my personal resources.

We set up a new testnet producer this month, to improve performance.

### Validationcore

**URLs**: https://validationcore.io

**List of SCs**: -

**Update**:
- On request we have changed the logic for partial and full Hyperion nodes. Previously the "full" flag has not been saved to the database. The new logic allows us to more accurately display of the status of Hyperion nodes on the validationcore. This turned out to be a slightly bigger change, as expected because, as we needed to find a way to incorporate it into the current database design.

Stats: Not tracked, but it is safe to say the validationcore is an essential part of the OIG evaluations itself :)
