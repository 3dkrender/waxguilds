### illusive GG

**URLs**: https://illusive.gg

**List of SCs**: illusiveauth

**Update**:
- Last month we launched our AI features for illusive. We are tracking the user data to determine which features to build out next and what to focus on.
- We had talks with a couple of games on launching campaigns incentivizing users to create content (write to earn), however, we are currently unsure if this will work in the current landscape of WAX. We are always happy to hear more opinions on this and we will continue our talks hopefully launching some campaigns soon or focusing on a different approach.
- Until then, we will leave the current feature set as is, to ensure we spend our development time on the right features.
