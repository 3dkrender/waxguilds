### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We have upgraded hyperion to latest version 3.3.10
We noticed that some monitoring services reported downtime for our hyperion v2 node for example
https://wax.sengine.co/guilds/eosdacserver,  https://nodestatus.ledgerwise.io/wax/producer/eosdacserver?tab=errors
while others showed 100% uptime, for example https://wax.validationcore.io/stats/guild/eosdacserver
We have added additional monitoring to catch these issues in future
