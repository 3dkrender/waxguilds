1. (Still upcoming due to Blumint side delays) Larger partnerships with Blumint.com to bring new web2 player guilds into Dark Country, so mainly into WAX as they do support WAX on the platform. We are giving 2500$ budget for June to run 10-15 events(mainly tournaments) and expect to receive several hundreds new players. 
2. Wombat and Dark Country partnership
