## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### NFT Backer

We have released a product that allows people to back any NFT with any token. 

We built an [open source smart contract](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/backed_nfts_v2) and an [open source indexer/oracle (using Thalos)](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/nftbacker-indexer) that allows authorizers to agree on who the backed assets belong to after an asset is burned.

Currenly, NeftyBlocks and EOSUSA are both running oracles (WaxDAO obviously is too), and over 1,100 NFTs have already been backed since the release of this tool.

### WAXDAO Improvements

- We built a [powerup tool](https://waxdao.io/powerup) the same day powerup was released on mainnet. It's currently averaging about 120 powerups per week.

- Our [token explorer](https://waxdao.io/tokens) has seen many improvements. There are now charts showing 7 day price movement. Prices, percentage changes etc are all actually providing accurate data now. You can sort by liquidity, see which different exchanges each token is trading on, view how much liquidity each exchange pair has, etc. This data will also be available via a public API which I planned to have finished by now, but have prioritized attracting new developers to the chain for the time being, so this API has to wait until next evaluation.

- New explorer features (the goal is to have a full on explorer eventually, where users can explore collections/accounts etc). So far, we have done: 

 	- Complete overhaul of [user profile pages](https://waxdao.io/u/j2hr4.wam), showing all relevant details for each user (such as what farms/daos/drops/blends etc they have created). You can also view their entire NFT inventory with proper sorting by collection/schema etc. Brand new NFT cards that actually look good. View whether an NFT is backed, have the option to back another user's NFTs, etc.

	- Most pages on waxdao (including the profile page above) are now using a custom API that provides WAXDAO data. This is still being improved and cleaned up, but will be available for public use just like the token API.

	- New gallery feature added where users can highlight up to 60 of their favorite NFTs to display on their profile page. In gallery mode, only the actual images are shown, which lets people show off their favorites without having to look at the full NFT card and all its buttons.

	- [Asset ID pages](https://waxdao.io/asset/1099919458451)

- [DAO Pages](https://waxdao.io/v2/daos/waxhispano) and [Proposal pages](https://waxdao.io/v2/waxhispano/proposals/43) were completely redesigned. Couple of missing features / QOL things were added, and a contract bug was fixed where users who voted on the same proposal multiple times were only getting the first vote counted.

- Redesigned the [NFT Farm Creator](https://waxdao.io/create-farm) page, [DAO Creator](https://waxdao.io/v2/create-dao) page, and [Token Farm Creator](https://waxdao.io/create-pool) page

- Token migration, Dynamic Pricing, and buybacks/burns - We have migrated to a new token and created a [custom TWAP contract](https://waxblock.io/account/twap.waxdao) which allows WAXDAO token to gain more buying power against our own products as the price increases. Also, we now use 100% of our platform fees to buyback/burn WAXDAO token, and to add liquidity to the WAX/WAXDAO pair. While I realize this is not necessarily a "product update", I do think that having strong project tokens on our chain can potentially help us attract users to WAX Blockchain as a whole, since they may see opportunity in individual projects.

- Updated our ad banner contract and UI so users can now rent multiple ad slots at once, rather than submitting 50 transactions to rent different time slots.

- Updated our [drops page](https://waxdao.io/drops) with new UI and drop cards, also added the ability to search by collection.

- New [wallet page](https://waxdao.io/wallet) was released, with much better UI, filtering/sorting options, ability to transfer tokens, back NFTs, create galleries, burn NFTs, much more intuitive icons for different actions/info related to each NFT... Claim section to claim any tokens from burned NFTs that were backed. The old wallet page is still available at [waxdao.io/inventory](https://waxdao.io/inventory), all of the creator stuff will be moved to a separate creator panel which is still being worked on.

- LP Locker is gaining traction and actually getting some use now, which I believe is important for adding trust to the DeFi scene on WAX. We released a [medium article](https://blog.waxdao.io/waxdao-releases-liquidity-locker-for-the-wax-blockchain-32cecbd7c411) about it, and highlighted it on our homepage, which may be part of the reason for the momentum increasing. Currently, there are now 62 total locks created on WaxDAO (probably 55-60 if you account for the couple test locks I've done). You can view the tables/transactions on the [waxdaolocker contract](https://waxblock.io/account/waxdaolocker) if you are curious to check details for yourself. Also, we are working on better explorer features related to the locker (i.e. "how can I view if a project has locked tokens?")... locked liquidity is also a metric we plan on adding to the token explorer/API so you can easily see how much liquidity is locked when searching for tokens.

- Also released 2 more WaxDAO-related medium articles, one for [new profile pages](https://blog.waxdao.io/new-profile-page-on-waxdao-6b1c8ddf80df), and another for [Dynamic Pricing](https://blog.waxdao.io/waxdao-launches-dynamic-pricing-6e883c544273)

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Yes, we have been working on a step by step tutorial for showing new developers how to utilize the Unity SDK in their project.

So far, we have released 8 in-depth articles and do not plan on stopping any time soon.

The goal is to eventually turn these into a complete video series as well (I've applied for a small [waxlabs grant](https://labs.wax.io/proposals/190) to support this initiative, FYI, but to be honest I'll do it regardless of whether I get the grant or not)
