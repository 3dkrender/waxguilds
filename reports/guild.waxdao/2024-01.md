## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

- Designed a brand new homepage at [waxdao.io](https://waxdao.io) with a UI that doesn't look like cancer, and has a custom-built swap form built on top of Alcor

- Migrated waxdao from UAL to wharfkit for wallet sessions / transaction signing

- Built a new feature to switch between multiple different wallet sessions on waxdao, instead of having to log out and back in every time you want to change wallets

- Added a "show NSFW" toggle and "autoplay video NFTs" toggle to our front end, and added option to switch Chain API for users who want more control over who they submit transactions to

- Made a few minor updates to our token-locker contract, and built a [brand new UI](https://waxdao.io/liquidity-locker) specifically tailored towards locking LP tokens. Taco and Defibox are currently supported, Alcor no longer uses tokens to represent LP ownership so it will require some creativity to find a way to add Alcor support.

- waxdao.io/tokens now tracks data for over 4400 tokens, since we recently added tracking of LP tokens 

- Resigned the entire UI for waxdao.io/tokens, as well as the individual token pages

- You can now filter by LP tokens, syntetic tokens, and regular tokens as well as sort by price (in addition to the previous sorting methods)

- Sorting and filtering experience is much better now, since we built a custom back-end API to return properly paginated data. Previously, the full list of tokens was loaded on the front end, then javascript magic for filtering/sorting. This resulted in terrible performance, as well as inconsistent pagination (you might've ended up with pages that had 0 results based on your filters). Now, our back end handles your request and returns you exactly what you need from a database. (Search bar is the last thing that needs to be taken care of still, it will be connected to the back end soon too)

- Token tracker now tracks liquidity depth for each token, across Alcor, Taco and Defibox. You can look at a token page [Nefty for example](https://waxdao.io/tokens/NEFTY@token.nefty), click the Markets tab and see that it has $27k in liquidity on the Nefty/Wax pair on Taco

- For LP tokens, we are now tracking the underlying assets and displaying them on token pages. For example, on the [TACWAXA page](https://waxdao.io/tokens/TACWAXA@swap.taco), you can see that this token is an LP token representing the TACO/WAXUSDT pair

- Richlist and holder counts are now displayed on token pages

- Supply info for all tracked tokens is now updated on a daily basis to keep up to date info

- Logos from alcor's repo are fetched automatically every 15 minutes, so if a user adds a logo to alcor, they are adding it with waxdao as well

- All this token data is part of a plan to build a custom API that we expect to have publicly released by next evaluation. We'll be tracking/providing price, liquidity and volume data across the 3 big markets on wax. We also plan to use this data, along with LP locks and a couple other things to develop a "trust score" for tokens on wax.

- [Farms page](https://waxdao.io/farms) has been completely redesigned, with its own custom backend API to provide properly paginated/filtered/sorted data, similar to the token tracker. V1 and V2 farms are now all shown on 1 page, so users dont need to worry about jumping back and forth to different parts of the website. Performance has drastically increased here as well, due to not loading 1000 farms at once and then using javascript to sort/filter them. Even the search bar is connected to the backend now, so when you type into it, you're requesting info from a database instead of just searching the 50 farms currently on the page.
