### WaxDAO Farms And DAOs

**URLs**: https://waxdao.io

**List of SCs**: waxdaofarmer, farms.waxdao, dao.waxdao

**Update**: 
- Several minor UI updates for the farms, such as select all / select 100 / select 500 buttons on the v2 farms since users with too many NFTs would get failed transactions trying to stake. Fixed an issue with depositing tokens into a farm's reward pool via the public farm page. Fixed a contract issue with v2 farms overestimating how many periods were left before a farm expires. Other minor UI improvements.

- Minor UI updates for DAOs, such as proposals not showing a finalize button in certain cases after the proposal ended. Fixed a DAO contract bug that was incorrectly allowing a proposal to pass in certain cases if it didn't meet the minimum amount of votes set by a DAO.

### WaxFusion Liquid Staking Protocol

**URLs**:
[Token Contract](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/token.fusion)
[DApp Contract](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/dapp.fusion)
[POL Contract](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/pol.fusion)
[CPU Rental Contract](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/cpu.fusion)
[Node JS Worker Bot](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/fusion_worker)


**List of SCs**: dapp.fusion, token.fusion, pol.fusion, cpu1.fusion, cpu2.fusion, cpu3.fusion

**Update**: 

- Created [public documentation](https://docs.waxfusion.io) for WaxFusion

- Launched a [public UI](https://test.waxfusion.io) and did a trial run on testnet to have users report bugs/feature requests etc

- Made many improvements to the pol.fusion and dapp.fusion contracts, and created a [new repo](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/waxfusion) that includes all of the updated contracts, as well as a very comprehensive list of unit tests/simulations which helped us to identify/fix several bugs. The unit tests also include several "mock" contracts that allow us to simulate behavior of other contracts like Alcor, eosio.system etc

- Submitted 3 of the contracts for audit so far. The token.fusion and cpu.fusion contracts have been given a green light, and am currently awaiting audit results for the pol.fusion contract. The dapp.fusion contract is ready for audit, just waiting on results from the pol contract before submitting the dapp.fusion contract. Expecting to have this launched on mainnet before the next evaluation.

- Got most of the logos/branding created for WaxFusion

- Created a public [worker app](https://docs.waxfusion.io/worker-app) to allow anyone to add redundancy to the protocol. Worth noting that due to updating the contracts to comply with the audit, some adjustments do need to be made to this worker app now (certain actions have different parameters now etc)
