### New: WaxFusion Liquid Staking Protocol

[POL Contract](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/pol.fusion)
[CPU Rental Contract](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/cpu.fusion)
[Node JS Worker Bot](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/fusion_worker)

(These are currently private repos, I am creating a Github team with the 3 of you so you can view them)

**List of SCs**: dapp.fusion, token.fusion, pol.fusion, cpu1.fusion, cpu2.fusion, cpu3.fusion

**Intro**: 
Sponsored privately by the WAX team, we are creating a fully open-source, multisig liquid staking platform that will allow WAX holders to earn yield from their WAX while also having liquid capital.

WaxFusion will serve as a foundation for other projects to build on top of, by creating a source of real, sustainable yield. 

There will be 2 tokens:
- SWAX (non-transferable, earns a sum of WAX that can be claimed from WaxFusion each day)
- LSWAX (the liquified version of SWAX, which autocompounds)

Users can liquify/unliquify their tokens as needed.

The core principle that WaxFusion is based off of, is our innovative flywheel mechanism that compounds our POL (protocol owned liquidity) on a daily basis. POL will be permanently locked inside the WaxFusion contracts and will never be able to be removed unless somehow enough msig parties (wax team, OIG etc) decided to do so.

When users stake in WaxFusion, they earn not only from their own WAX, but from our POL - which compounds from fees generated by the platform.

Fees come from a % of all earnings from staked WAX, as well as from renting out our WAX via a CPU rental at the lowest cost on the market.

In addition, the WAX team has agreed to not only seed this protocol owned liquidity with an initial pool of WAX, but to add to it over time since it can never actually be spent anyway.

They have also agreed to seed initial liquidity for the WAX/LSWAX pair on Alcor, which again can not be touched by us.

Funds earned by the platform will be automatically distributed to:

- Liquidity for WAX/LSWAX
- Ecosystem fund (supporting several WAX projects through buybacks etc, including Hive, Nefty, AtomicHub, WaxDAO, and others)
- ve33 fund (there will be a voting mechanism for LSWAX holders to vote on which liquidity pairs are able to receive a portion of WaxFusion revenue each week)

The smart contracts automatically vote for all top 21 block producers on a daily basis, to avoid any sort of bias (i.e. voting for WaxDAO with all the user funds). In the future when this grows large enough to matter, it would really be awesome if we could come up with some sort of solution for OIG elections too, like allowing people to submit weighted votes. This way platforms like WaxFusion could let all their users vote with their SWAX/LSWAX, and submit the tally to the OIG election (50% Rakeden, 30% new guy, 20% other new guy etc). But this is a topic for another time :)

We are not only open sourcing the entire project, but also creating an open source node js app for people to run a worker bot if they want to add some redundancy to the platform (WaxFusion requires some actions to be called every so often, like unstaking WAX, claiming voting rewards etc)

Fusion is fully running on testnet right now (except for the ve33 mechanic which was not part of the original proposal), undergoing code review, beta testing and getting some branding and documentation completed before releasing officially on mainnet.

Doing a great job with re-evaluating what's important (ecosystem dev) at this time, and the overhaul of Notion. Keep it up.
