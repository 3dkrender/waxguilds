## 6 Week Hyperion Snapshot

We have decided to stop offering 6 week Hyperion snapshots, due to the fact there are no points being awarded and it is resource heavy. We still believe that there are many use cases and will be happy to reconsider offering again in the future if the effort is rewarded.

## Docker Project

We've revamped our Docker build projects, which are now hosted at https://github.com/oneinacillian/docker_compose_autobuilds. These projects provide two Docker Compose solutions equipped with the necessary logic and builds to spin up a multi-container application, establishing a Wax Atomic and Hyperion Solution.

Please refer to the README for detailed usage instructions. These comprehensive solutions can be deployed within minutes, greatly facilitating testing purposes.

The environments are highly configurable and easy to understand, making them ideal for forking and testing any development features. Further details are provided in the README for reference.

### Updates:

- Use of Vendor Images: Implemented on 2024-02-11 for improved performance and stability, leveraging optimised images for applications.
- Addition of Atomic Deployment: Enhanced usability on 2024-02-11 with the addition of quick and customisable Atomic deployments tailored for testing purposes.
- Customisable Environment: Improved usability on 2024-02-11 by introducing an option for auto-launching applications, facilitating quick testing.
- Incorporation of Dependency Checks on Services: Implemented on 2023-02-13 to ensure all dependent services are operational before launching Hyperion or Atomic.

We'll continue to enhance and utilise these projects for testing new features before rollout. Your feedback is appreciated for further improvements.
