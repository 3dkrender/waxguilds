## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Since our last update we have been working hard on developing a new product in time for this update, but unfortunatly we are going to need to keep you in suspense until the next update.

While testing, we did come up with a tool that we found really useful and we think others guilds will too, so we have shared with the community.

## 6 Week Hyperion Snapshot

Regular maintenenece and testing continues in order to provide regular snapshots which includes the latest 6 weeks of data for partial history restore including up to 90 days worth of data.

Current size of index (for partial) is roughly 1.1TB. 

* The ES snapshot contains 6 weeks of blockchain indexed data. 

 https://wiki.oiac.io/snapshots/ provides an explanation of how to configure the repository, listing the desired snapshot to restore as well as the process required for the restoration to take place.

Each snapshot is validated for missing blocks using Hyperion 3.3.6 API. All blocks are indexed fully up to the time the snapshot was taken.

We have a dedicated cluster [4 es instances] running with optimizations and proper sharding to optimize the clean-up operations so that the snapshots can be made available daily and in a timely fashion.

## Docker Project

As a result of extensive testing of multiple features within the Hyperion stack, with the goal of delivering a new product, we realised the importance of having a consolidated and customisable environment that can be quickly spun up and down for testing, all while maintaining a small footprint.

Having done this, we thought it could also be helpful for guilds wanting to test new version changes and implementations and so we have shared the repository with the community through various Telegram channels.
