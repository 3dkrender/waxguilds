### <ins>Docker Project</ins>

https://github.com/oneinacillian/docker_compose_autobuilds  

**Update**: 
We have made several significant enhancements to our Docker Project to improve flexibility, stability, and ease of use. Here are the key updates:

**Hyperion Version Control as a Variable**:

* This update allows users to easily switch and test new versions of Hyperion. By controlling the Hyperion version through a variable, we ensure that upgrades and rollbacks are seamless and less error-prone.

**Elasticsearch (ES) Memory Parameters as a Variable**:

* Users can now control Elasticsearch memory parameters through a variable. This flexibility helps in optimising performance based on the specific needs of the environment, whether for development, testing, or production.

**Latest Hyperion Deployment Testing**:

* We have successfully tested the latest Hyperion deployment (version 3.3.10-1) within the stack. This deployment has been validated through indexer jobs and API health status checks, ensuring robustness and reliability.

**Customised Nodeos Deb Deployments**:

* We have introduced the ability to customise Nodeos deb deployments and implement dynamic modifications required for startup environments. This feature allows users to easily switch to and test different versions of Nodeos, facilitating rapid testing and deployment of new features.

These improvements aim to provide a more flexible and resilient infrastructure for our users, making it easier to maintain and enhance blockchain applications.

### <ins>Telegram Bot for Block Producer Notifications TESTNET</ins>

**Update**: 
We have introduced a new Telegram bot for monitoring missing blocks on the testnet. Unlike our mainnet offering, this testnet bot does not monitor empty blocks.

* Access: Join the channel using the following link: @oiacblockinfotestnet
* Purpose: This bot ensures that block producers on the testnet stay informed about any missing blocks, allowing for timely interventions and improvements.

### <ins>Full Blocks Snapshots</ins>

**Update**: 
OIAC has started providing Full Blocks snapshots.

* Repository URL: https://stateblocks.oiac.io
* Frequency: Weekly
* Purpose: These snapshots are crucial for developers and block producers to have a comprehensive record of all blocks, ensuring seamless synchronisation and recovery processes.
