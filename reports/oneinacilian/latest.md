### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
Our TestNet Hyperion API certificate expired, and the monitoring solution failed to capture this event. However, we have rectified the issue and implemented the necessary monitoring to prevent such unnecessary outages from recurring.

### Docker Project

https://github.com/oneinacillian/docker_compose_autobuilds  

**Update**: 
Over the past six weeks, we have validated the latest Elasticsearch/Kibana version (8.13.2) with Hyperion 3.3.8-9 and Nodeos version v4.0.4wax01 on Autoobuilds. Additionally, we have implemented port lockdowns on Docker to restrict access to localhost on Hyperion for enhanced security, particularly in scenarios where Docker networking and firewall configurations may not be fully understood.

### Missing & Empty Blocks Monitoring Tool

**Update**: 
None this period

### 6 Week Hyperion Snapshot

https://wiki.oiac.io/snapshots/

**Update**: 
We had a request from one of our fellow guilds to make this service live again, after recently retiring due to the fact there is no points awarded, and therefore not the most efficint allocation of resources. We still believe that there are many use cases and would be very grateful should the OIG reconsider the award of points.
