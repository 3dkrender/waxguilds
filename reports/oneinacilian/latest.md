### <ins>May 2024 Update</ins>
We are pleased to provide an update on the latest developments and contributions from Oneinacillian to the WAX blockchain ecosystem. Over the past period, we have introduced three valuable resources to support the community: Chain DB snapshots, Atomic snapshots, and a new Telegram bot. Below are the details for each offering:
In addition to the snapshots, we are launching a new Telegram bot designed to notify block producers of any empty or missing blocks. This bot provides a detailed report every 24 hours, helping to maintain the integrity and performance of the blockchain.
### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We experienced an outage during the previous evaluation period affecting our test net block producer. On two separate occasions, our block producer missed rounds: 9 rounds on the 23rd of May and 33 rounds on the 26th of May. The issue was traced back to a corrupted state database, which caused the block producer to stop synchronising blocks.
In response, we reinitialised the block producer and carried out thorough maintenance to ensure stability moving forward.

### Telegram Bot for Block Producer Notifications

**Update**: 
We have developed a new Telegram bot, using the Sentnl API, to enhance the monitoring capabilities for block producers. This bot sends a message every 24 hours, detailing the number of empty blocks by guild and any missing blocks within the same period, along with exact timestamps.
* Access: Join the channel using the following link: @oiacblockinfo
* Purpose: This bot ensures that block producers stay informed about block performance issues, allowing for timely interventions and improvements.

### Chain DB Snapshots

**Update**: 
We now provide regular Chain DB snapshots, for both main net and test net, to facilitate easier and faster blockchain synchronisation for new nodes and to support developers in their testing and development efforts.
* Repository URL: https://mainnetsnapshots.oiac.io & https://testnetsnapshots.oiac.io
* Frequency: Daily
* Purpose: These snapshots help reduce the time required to sync new nodes and provide a reliable backup solution.

---

### Atomic Snapshots

**Update**: 
In addition to the Chain DB snapshots, we are also offering Atomic snapshots. These snapshots are crucial for developers and users working with the AtomicAssets standard, enabling quicker access to the latest state of the assets on the blockchain.
* Repository URL: https://atomicmainsnapshots.oiac.io/ 
* Frequency: Daily
* Purpose: These snapshots support the efficient development and deployment of DApps and provide a reliable backup for the AtomicAssets state.
