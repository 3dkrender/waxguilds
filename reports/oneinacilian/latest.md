### <ins>August 2024 Update</ins>
We are pleased to provide an update on the latest developments and contributions from Oneinacilian to the WAX blockchain ecosystem. 

### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
Over the past period, we have been actively developing a monitoring initiative. This is a new mechanism aimed at providing greater visibility and proactive monitoring for solutions running within the WAX ecosystem. Our efforts are focused on creating a system that can:

* <ins>Monitor OIG Portals:</ins> Automatically alert guilds when critical components are impaired or flagged as down.
* <ins>State Availability Tracking:</ins> Keep a close watch on the availability of state data to ensure uninterrupted access.
* <ins>Snapshot Monitoring:</ins> Track and report on the status of snapshots being taken, providing timely updates on their availability.

Our goal is to eventually package these monitoring capabilities into a comprehensive solution that we believe will be highly beneficial for all guilds. We look forward to sharing more details as this project progresses.
