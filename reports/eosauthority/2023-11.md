WAX Deplhi Oracle code has been updated https://github.com/eosauthority/wax-delphioracle-exchanges it now supports USDC & USDT prices. The code has been changed to allow a ticker to be fetched from any exchange that is available. The order of fallback of exchanges can be set in code. So if a particular price is not available from an exchange or if the exchange API is not available then the script tries to fetch the price from the next exchange and so on.
