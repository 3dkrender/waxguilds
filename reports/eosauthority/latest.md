The team has put together the blog linked above. OpenAI has now released the GPT public to all users for free. Our team is looking at how to add more support releated queries to be address and resolved by this system. The development team is looking at ways in which this system can be integrated directly into discord or other public channels too. The AI system can then lookup live account and network information to help users with their relevant queries. OIG's - please setup points for this WAX GPT project when possible.
