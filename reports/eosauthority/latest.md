The team has put together the blog linked above. The WAX team has agreed to promote the new AI system and we will explore ways in the future to integrate chat support to discord or other WAX channels. OpenAI has announced the launch to all users within a week or two and the WAX team is likely to promote this on their channels soon. We have over 100+ users (paid ChatGPT) users try this so far and over 100,000 API requests were processed so far. We look forward to wider launch when OpenAI releases the system to all users. The system is also updated to support multiple languages and send summary for user account / specific transaction.


### <ins>Feedback to OIG</ins>
1) Please reinstate the points for atomic as the system is now upgraded
2) WAX GPT does not have points allocated yet, the system is live for over a month now and usage reports as also submitted with this report.
