## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

On January 12th & 13th our testnet producer experienced issues with a node shutdown. After restart there was an issue with the cpu preventing maximum performance scaling. At no time was our two mainnet producers affected, however we did shut down one of them while we switch to new machines. The testnet node has been restored and is fully within performance specs with no change from the last report.
- WAX.json updated to remove one p2p endpoint and fix the error listing a history endpooint

Our full history node is fully sysnced but not yet public. Several issues prevented the Atomic API sync from completing so this will be restarted and it is planned to be ready before the next technical update.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Product #1 Waxstash Marketplace. https://waxstash.com | https://waxstash.io
- The waxstash.com and waxstash.io rebuild is still in development
- 5130 current listings outside of the Atomicmarket contract
- 1968 of the above are atomicassets the rest are simpleassets

Product #2 NFT Pack Breaks. https://packbreaks.io
- Packbreaks.io has just been expanded with a new Repack feature. Our repack contract is finished and users can now 'repack' their NFTs into a pack which is apportioned into 10 slots. Each time a slot is purchased all slots are shuffled. Finally when the 10th slot is purchased all slots and NFTs in the repack are shuffled together and airdropped to their respective slots owners
- Repacks also include a fully on-chain leaderboard, which will track numbers of packs sold & slots bought, as well as total WAX spent & earned.
- https://packbreaks.io/repacks
- Repack Rules:
- 1 - Each repack must contain 10 NFTs from the same collection
- 2 - Each NFT must be unique, meaning no duplicates
- 3 - An account cannot buy slots from their own repack
- 4 - Must be on the atomicassets standard or bridged to atomicassets
- 5 - 2% WAX contributed to WAX Defi
- We listed the first repack after launch for a final test but a full marketing campaign has yet to take place
- A universal pack breaker contract is still in the planning stage
