### <ins>Feedback to OIG</ins>
*[valuable feedback for the WAX OIG around the topics governance, guidelines, ...]*


"We would appreciate it if we could get higher points on our telegram bot as we are continuously maintaining and supporting over 1200+ users and monitoring over 3000+ accounts daily. We can also open up new Exchange listings as we have significant connections with regional exchanges and DeFi protocols, but to do this we would need support from the WAX team or OIGs as these things don't come free."
