## Product Development Updates
- WaxStats - Still providing testing metrics for all nodes/services throughout ecosystem:  wax.stats.eosusa.news
- AWStats - Still providing primary reporting services for AW community at reporting.eosusa.io.  Gets about 15K hits/month and we recently added a report to show monthly miner totals for AW game data back through 2021: reporting.eosusa.io/MinersByMonth
- AWButler - Still providing NFT drop services for half dozen projects in the space and recently added a new Chronaverse drop for their community (also deployed their token contract for them).
- WAX Minecraft - Kavian.World is still running and has been funded to run for another 6 month season.  We have increased the daily quest participation (from around 20 when we launched) to now 50+ players registering and 40+ players completing quests daily.  See for details: reporting.eosusa.io/QuestResume/.  We are also in talks with other projects about adding the services to their community Minecraft servers.
- Antelope Node Configurations - In an attempt to help node operators have a simple, minimal configuration for launching a WAX node for the most common uses, we have published the github.com/eosusa/antelope-config/ product to allow operators to easily get the settings we (EOSUSA) recommend for each role.  There are also simple start/stop scripts to assist with node management and includes a link to our public NodeOS Confugration Matrix spreadsheet that provides details and version availability information for many common parameters.
