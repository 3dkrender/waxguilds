### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
Been fighting alot of issues with our Hyperion clusters and working on building new clusters to replace them with the redeployed 10900Ks that are being replaced by new 14900Ks.  Deployed 2 new 14900Ks into the supporting infrastructure this month and will continue to slowly upgrade until public infrastructure is all on matching 14900K hardware.
