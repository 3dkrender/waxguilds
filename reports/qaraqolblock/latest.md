### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We have setup a full Hyperion node, AA Api, full Testnet Hyperion, Light API, IPFS, and more.
Our Light API is unused however we will focus on getting it utilized by WAX developers. We had some issue with our original ShiP node which caused some of our nodes to be out of sync temporarily but we rectified all technical issues and setup a backup.

List of SCs: n/a 

Update: We developed an open source IPFS script that allows guilds or anyone with an IPFS node to pin every single asset of top 30 Atomic Market collections or any of their choosing to their IPFS node. This will allow these essential WAX IPFS assets to be always available on these nodes, protect from censorship, and make it very easy to pin WAX assets.
