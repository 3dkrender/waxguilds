### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We started work on our new flagship product WAXMap to be introduced on call. We had some difficulties with our Hyperion previously, but it has been fixed. We have also setup backups for Atomic Assets and Chain DB. We are also almost done setting up Blocks Log and State History.

IPFS WAX Script:

URLs: https://github.com/qaraqol/ipfs-wax-script
New: https://github.com/qaraqol/WaxMarketCap-IPFS-script


List of SCs: n/a 

Update: We developed an open source IPFS script that allows guilds or anyone with an IPFS node to automatically pin every single asset of top 30 Atomic Market collections or any of their choosing to their IPFS node. In our new updated version, it automatically grabs the top 30 collections through the WaxMarketCap API, making it so the most important collections don't need to be provided manually

Qaraqol Tool Strategist (Alien Worlds)

URLs: https://strategist.qaraqol.com/


Update: We are working on new features and fixing bugs. We are planning slight changes to UI to make it easier to understand and use the tool before heavily advertising and onboarding new users.
