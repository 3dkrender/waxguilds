### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We faced issues with our full history Hyperion, causing us to resync. During the downtime we setup a partial hyperion as a backup. We released a major update to our strategist yesterday implementing many of the user suggestions and feedback to make the tool more useful and beginner friendly. 
Finished setting up state history and blocks log snapshots.

Qaraqol Tool Strategist (Alien Worlds)

URLs: https://strategist.qaraqol.com/


Update: Developed new feature to allow for users to change the NFT point exchange rate from $0-100 as requested by users instead of a default hardcoded rate. We also added multiple new filters/sliders on the Customize Build and All Builds page such as CPU in ms per day and TLM per day. Also added tooltips explaining what certain sliders mean to make the tool more beginner friendly and bring new users in to WAX and Alien Worlds.
