### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

Here's a brief summary of recent developments:


- The Atomic API has been officially launched.
- Hyperion has been fully indexed for the testnet, serving as a valuable resource for a team of developers as they work on building a software tool. Although initially intended for a Chinese team, we've decided to make it accessible to everyone.
- We have redundant instances of AtomicAPI for the mainnet, with two launched behind the Balancer.
- The indexing of Hyperion mainnet's partial history is underway and will be completed within a week.
- HAProxy rules have been adjusted to facilitate access.
- Webpage maintenance has been completed.
- wax.json has been updated on both the webpage and the chain.

### MetaPlay

We are developing an analytical platform called MetaPlay,MetaPlay is built on on-chain data, focusing on providing fundamental analysis for NFT and GameFi projects on the WAX blockchain. Beyond tracking price, volume, and market capitalization, MetaPlay also monitors community growth, significant events, and on-chain metrics to offer comprehensive insights into the ecosystem.

**Update**: 
At the moment, our team is focused on fine-tuning and improving the UI to deliver optimal user experiences. Additionally, we're implementing additional indexes for the data to enhance the speed of the API. Once these tasks are accomplished, we'll unveil the inaugural version of MetaPlay.

### <ins>Feedback to OIG</ins>

OIG's documentation got a bit mixed up regarding the AtomicAPI endpoints. It mentioned "/v1/atomi*" and "/v1/docs," but it's actually "/atomic*" and "/docs." Just a heads-up for developers looking to integrate with the API!
