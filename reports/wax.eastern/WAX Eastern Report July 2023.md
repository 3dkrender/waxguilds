## Community management initiatives

**Our Ongoing Community Management Initiatives**:

Engaging Trivia Events: Twice a week, our Telegram group hosts exciting trivia events, providing an interactive platform for community members. These events foster engagement and raise awareness about WAX-based projects among our members.

24/7 Support for the Chinese WAX Community: We are dedicated to providing round-the-clock support to the Chinese WAX community through our Telegram and Discord channels. Our team is readily available to answer queries, offer guidance, and address concerns.

Sharing Updates on Multiple Platforms: As part of our commitment to the community, we actively share the latest news, articles, and tweets about WAX on various social media platforms. Find us on Twitter, Discord, Weibo, and WeChat, where we strive to keep our community informed and engaged.

Continuous Exploration: We constantly explore fresh and innovative methods to engage and educate our members. Our goal is to support and foster the growth of the WAX community by continuously adapting and improving our strategies to meet their evolving needs.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

One suggestion we have for improvement is to foster more communication and collaboration among different Guilds. We believe that facilitating regular meetings or conferences specifically designed for Guild members would be beneficial. These gatherings can provide an opportunity for Guilds to share experiences, exchange ideas, and address common challenges.
