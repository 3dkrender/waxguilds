1. We have reached out to one of the top wallet--Bitkeep to support WAX Mainnet and luckily we've helped them successfully finish the integration. Now WAX users could use Bitkeep wallet to manage their WAX assets on mobile. We plan to do a series of campaigns with Bitkeep to promote WAX in Chinese market.

**Community management initiatives** :

Compare to last month, our WAX chinese communities has gained 4K+ new members.

Due to the policy of chinese gov towards crypto getting tight, two of our wechat groups got banned unfortunately. But we are still promoting the latest projects on WAX to our community members 

Except sharing the latest WAX related news and projects, we still doing the daily management and help rookies get onboard WAX.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Keep up the good work!
