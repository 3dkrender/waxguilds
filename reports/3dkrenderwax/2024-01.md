# 3DK Render WAX Guild - January 2024 Report

## Technical Operations

Currently, our mainnet validation nodes are running version 4.0.4. In our pursuit of continuous improvement, we have been testing new servers to enhance the performance of our nodes. The upgrade to Intel i9-13900 processors has resulted in a significant performance increase, as can be seen in the following image:

![CPU Benchmark](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cpubenmarch_24.png)

We are working on updating our AtomicAssets APIs from version 1.3.21 to version 1.3.24, but unfortunately, we are encountering some issues that are causing delays (errors in the database update). We hope to have it ready in the coming days.

In Testnet, we are testing version 5.0.0 of nodeos.

We continue to offer AtomicAssets API, Hyperion, query, and seed node services in both mainnet and testnet.

# Product Development
## Rada Quest TCG

### Development Status

The Christmas holiday period has slowed down the development of Rada Quest TCG. However, we have made progress in implementing the new guilds section, which we hope to launch in the coming weeks.

### New Cards

We are pleased to announce a new artistic collaboration for the creation of new cards. This collaboration is with the artist [Catrynart](https://hive.blog/@catrynart/posts), who is creating a series of illustrations that will become cards for Rada Quest TCG.

Some examples of her work:

![Catrynart](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/catrynart_02.png)

Collaborating with new artists is one of our most important goals. We want Rada Quest TCG to be a platform where artists can showcase their work and earn income and visibility for it. Unfortunately, our financial limitations prevent us from engaging in all the collaborations we would like, but we hope to continue growing and collaborating with more artists in the future.

We want to remind you that, as can be deduced from the game's statistics, our main source of funding comes from the Guild BP earnings on WAX.

### Some Stats

Statistics of the Rada Quest TCG portal between December 1, 2023, and January 13, 2024:

![Rada Quest TCG Stats](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stats_site_01-24.png)

We have noticed a slight decrease in activity, around 10%, which we believe is due to the Christmas holidays.

The Rada Quest TCG NFT collection on AtomicHub remains in a modest but stable position, as can be seen in the following image (position 120), which shows the sales volume of the last 60 days (source: [waxmarketcap](https://waxmarketcap.com/)):

![Rada Quest TCG Stats](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/collection_stats_01-24.png)

Similarly, according to data collected by [dappradar](https://dappradar.com/dapp/rada-quest-tcg), Rada Quest TCG remains in position 31 of the most popular games on WAX:

### Hive Community

We have activated several promotions on Hive Blog with the goal of attracting new players to Rada Quest TCG and therefore to WAX.

**Rada Quest Hive Community**

- https://hive.blog/hive-161342/@radaquest/embark-on-the-community-adventure-of-rada-quest

This is a permanent event. With this promotion, we aim to get Hive users to register on Rada Quest TCG, start playing, and share their experiences in the Hive community. In exchange, users will receive rewards in the form of Rada Quest TCG NFTs or other in-game items, so they will need to have a WAX Cloud Wallet account.

**Rada Quest Art Contest**

- https://hive.blog/hive-161342/@radaquest/rada-quest-art-contest-edition-i

This is an art contest in which Hive users can participate by creating illustrations inspired by the universe of Rada Quest. The winners will receive rewards in the form of Rada Quest TCG NFTs or other in-game items, so they will need to have a WAX Cloud Wallet account. The contest is currently underway and will be held every 2 weeks.

*We believe that synergy with the Hive community can be very interesting as it is a community deeply connected to blockchain ecosystems and the web3 environment.*

## Social engagement

During this period, we have maintained our active social media presence and continued to foster collaborations. We have surpassed the milestone of creating over 5000 accounts within the game, and our efforts to attract new players are ongoing, focusing on informing them about the game's diverse gameplay, community features, and other offerings.

## Client/Server WAX Template

We continue working on improving the public access template for the creation of client/server applications for WAX.

This template is designed to facilitate access to the WAX Blockchain ecosystem for developers who do not have experience in developing within this environment.

Updates:
- Support for Wombat Wallet
- Multi-account support

Public repository: https://github.com/3dkrender/WAX_CS_Template

## Blenderizer Tools

We continue working on the frontend tool for using our smart contract Blenderizer. We have optimized the code to speed up searches for collections and ingredients that can be used to create new NFTs through the mixes registered in the smart contract.

We are currently working on the ingredient matching system between different users to facilitate direct exchange between them.

# Ecosystem Development

Additionally, we have included an article on the use of the Wharfkit framework for maintaining multiple sessions in web applications.
