### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

Over the last month we have experienced a few reboots of one of our nodes that make up the Hyperion data cluster. Thanks to redundancy, consistency and availability problems have been minimal. However, we are in the process of adding a new node to increase reliability and availability in case this problem persists and we have to permanently replace the affected node.
