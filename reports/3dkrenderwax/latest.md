## Translation of Tools Section to Spanish

This PR adds comprehensive Spanish translations for the Tools section of the WAX Developer documentation, making these essential development resources accessible to Spanish-speaking developers.

### Files Translated

- **Operating Systems Support** (`docs/es/build/tools/os.md`)
  - Complete translation of supported OS requirements and Windows development options
  - Updated internal links to point to Spanish documentation paths

- **Blockchain Tools** (`docs/es/build/tools/blockchain_tools.md`)
  - Translation of keosd, nodeos, and cleos tool descriptions
  - Maintained technical accuracy while improving accessibility for Spanish speakers

- **WAX-CDT Options** (`docs/es/build/tools/cdt_options.md`)
  - Comprehensive translation of all CDT command descriptions and parameters
  - Translated command descriptions while preserving CLI syntax and technical parameters
  - Covered cdt-abidiff, cdt-cpp, cdt-init, and cdt-ld tools with detailed option explanations

- **Ricardian Contracts** (`docs/es/build/tools/ricardian_contract.md`)
  - Translation of Ricardian contract concepts and implementation guide
  - Maintained legal and technical precision in contract terminology
  - Updated code examples and internal documentation links

- **Ricardian Clauses** (`docs/es/build/tools/ricardian_clause.md`)
  - Complete translation including complex legal contract example
  - Translated all legal clause titles and content while maintaining juridical accuracy
  - Preserved HTML structure and technical implementation details

### Translation Approach

- **Technical Fidelity**: All command names, file extensions, and CLI parameters remain in English as part of the development interface
- **Linguistic Accuracy**: Technical concepts translated with precision to maintain clarity for Spanish-speaking developers
- **Link Maintenance**: Internal documentation links updated to reference Spanish versions (`/es/` paths)
- **Code Preservation**: All code examples, HTML structures, and technical syntax preserved exactly

This translation work significantly improves accessibility for the Spanish-speaking WAX developer community while maintaining the technical integrity of the original documentation.
