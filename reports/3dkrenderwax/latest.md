# New Product

### Pug Tapper (Telegram Game)

**URLs**: https://t.me/pugtapper_bot

#### Introduction

**Pug Tapper** is our new game that not only promises fun and entertainment but also acts as a connection point between different blockchain and non-blockchain ecosystems. This game represents an innovative way to integrate communities and platforms, offering a unique experience to players and establishing a bridge to new opportunities in the blockchain world.

#### Spirit of the Game

Pug Tapper is designed with the spirit of creating an collaborative environment. Our goal is to use the game as a funnel that connects the Telegram community with the WAX blockchain, as well as with various applications available on this blockchain. The idea is to foster a dynamic and active community where players from different games and platforms can interact and benefit from each other.

#### Ecosystem Integration Strategy

1. Connection between Telegram and WAX
- **Telegram Community**: Pug Tapper is launched on Telegram, where we already have an active community. Through daily rewards and special events, we encourage continuous participation and player loyalty.
- **Bridge to WAX**: We use Pug Tapper to direct players to the WAX blockchain, offering them additional benefits and rewards when they engage with applications and games on WAX.

2. Strategic Collaborations
- **Rada Quest**: We are currently collaborating with Rada Quest. This collaboration allows Rada Quest players to earn rewards in Pug Tapper by completing activities in their game. This synergy not only enriches the player experience but also strengthens the communities of both games.
- **Expanding Collaborations**: As more projects join as collaborators, we foresee a vibrant community of players coming from different games and platforms. These collaborations will facilitate greater interaction and movement within the ecosystem, creating a more robust and diverse environment.

#### Benefits for the Community

1. Enriched Gaming Experience
- Players have the opportunity to enjoy cross-game and cross-platform rewards and benefits.
- The diversity of activities and rewards keeps players engaged and motivated.

2. Community Growth and Expansion
- As more projects join, the Pug Tapper community will grow, attracting players from different ecosystems.
- Interaction among players from different games will foster a broader and more diverse sense of community.

3. Fostering Innovation
- The integration of different platforms and games creates an environment conducive to innovation and the development of new ideas and collaborations.

#### Conclusion

Pug Tapper is not just a game but a strategic tool for connecting and enriching different ecosystems. Through our collaborations and integration strategies, we are creating an interconnected and dynamic player community. We hope this approach will not only increase the number of active users but also strengthen the position of Pug Tapper and our associated platforms in the market.

---

#### Next Steps

1. **Strengthen Collaboration with Rada Quest**: Implement more joint activities and promote cross-rewards to increase participation.
2. **Seek New Collaborations**: Identify and establish partnerships with other games and platforms on the WAX blockchain and beyond.
3. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continue monitoring player activity and adjusting our strategies to maximize impact and engagement.
