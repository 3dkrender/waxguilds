### Rada Quest (Trading Card Game)

**URLs**: https://radaquest.net, https://game.radaquest.net

**List of SCs**: radaquesttcg, radaunpacker, radarentmain, tarukofficer

**Update**:

Developing: We are receiving many requests to port the game to mobile devices so we are studying the feasibility of the project. We find it interesting since it can attract more players. We have been doing feasibility studies of the project for a migration to mobile devices and even as an integrated Telegram or Discord application. Due to these studies and the tests carried out, all the development work of this period has been minimized both in this project and in the other projects that we develop.

**WUFFI Partnership**

We have implemented the partner plan with WUFFI. Rada Quest will distribute WUF tokens through the game and various activities to the community.
Distribution of WUF to the community:

- Gem Tournament: Prize pool divided among the top 3 places.
- Coliseum: WUF is distributed each round to players who score more than 5000 points in the arena.
- Rada Lotto: One lucky winner receives WUF.

**Fan Art**

We're continuing our fan art contest while attracting the HIVE community to connect with our art and, consequently, our game.
