### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

In order to improve the availability of our Hyperion query service, we have added a node to the Elasticsearch data cluster. Due to the large size of the current Mainnet database, nodes require time to synchronize replicas between them. Due to the overhead of shard rebalancing, Guilds monitors are intermittently showing timeout issues when accessing our Elasticsearch API. We hope that in the next few days all nodes in the cluster will have stabilized and these access issues will be resolved.

**Testnet**

In Testnet we have upgraded our Hyperion service to version 3.5 so that it can join the Hub service "QRY Network". For the moment we will only be testing with version 3.5 in Testnet until we have guarantees of stability.

**Update**:

We are excited to provide the community with an overview of Rada Quest, offering a deeper insight into what lies behind the game. Rada Quest is not just a trading card game (TCG); it’s a unique fusion of art and gameplay where players can not only enjoy the strategy of the game but also collect the artistic pieces that make it special.

**More Metrics**

Even though we are noticing a general decline in the number of players across the entire WAX ​​ecosystem, Rada Quest continues to achieve acceptable engagement and player loyalty ratios, as can be seen in these graphs.

- Rank 18 in the WAX games category
- 273 UAW (Unique Active Wallets) 30 days average

> *Note*: DappRadar metrics are not very representative as they are based on user interaction with our smart contracts and there are some operations, such as participating in the Gems minigame or the Coliseum, that do not require signing transactions. We have reduced transaction signing to reduce costs for players.

### Pug Tapper (Telegram Game)

**URLs**: https://t.me/pugtapper_bot

#### Ecosystem Integration Strategy

In our interest to make Pug Tapper a bridge between multi-chain communities, we have incorporated the option for players to associate the ImmutabelX chain account from the main Dungeon Keeper Studios website.

Note: We have completely redesigned the official Dungeon Keeper Studios website to improve the integration of our games and services: https://dungeonkeeperstudios.com

This period, we have focused on introducing PugTapper to the TON ecosystem. The game was featured in the "Gaming Innovation" segment, hosted by the Mixie AI community, which brings together prominent influencers and ambassadors from the TON ecosystem. The event was simulcast via X Spaces, reaching over 4,200 listeners live and 24,000 through the broadcast for this event.
We are continuing collaborations with other projects to drive further growth and visibility.

**Strategic Collaborations**
- **Rada Quest**: We continue to collaborate with Rada Quest. Some activities within the Rada Quest game grant Coins in Pug Tapper. Additionally, Rada Quest has offered Pug Tapper players the ability to purchase various NFTs in exchange for the Coins earned. These NFTs are used as special cards for the current Coliseum event in Rada Quest, so they are very useful.

**Some Metrics**

- **Daily active players**: ~200
