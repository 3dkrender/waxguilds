**List of SCs**: radaquesttcg, radaunpacker, radarentmain, tarukofficer

**Update**:

We are continuing to adapt the game for mobile. In the meantime, we have improved some sections of the UI to make it more responsive and added the option to convert in-game resources into tradable NFTs.

**WUFFI Partnership**

Our partnership with WUFFI remains strong as we continue to distribute WUF tokens through our game. The community has embraced this partnership with enthusiasm, leading to high participation across all related activities.

**More Metrics**

Internal metrics show a stable number of active users in the last period.

30 days period. Data from DappRadar:

- Rank 19 in the WAX games category
- 291 UAW (Unique Active Wallets) 30 days average

> *Note*: DappRadar metrics are not very representative as they are based on user interaction with our smart contracts and there are some operations, such as participating in the Gems minigame or the Coliseum, that do not require signing transactions. We have reduced transaction signing to reduce costs for players.

### Pug Tapper (Telegram Game)

**URLs**: https://t.me/pugtapper_bot

#### Ecosystem Integration Strategy

Pug Tapper's main goal is to serve as a link between communities. So far we have only consolidated collaborations within WAX but we hope to be able to expand our offer of collaborations to other chains to serve as a bridge between the different communities.

The main use of Pug Tapper is the generation of Coins, either directly in the game or through activities in our collaborators' applications. With these Coins, players will be able to buy improvements within the game or they will be able to buy assets that the collaborating projects will offer to the Tappers community.

1. Connection between Telegram and WAX
- **Telegram Community**: Pug Tapper is launched on Telegram, where we already have an active community. Through daily rewards and special events, we encourage continuous participation and player loyalty.
- **Bridge to WAX**: We use Pug Tapper to direct players to the WAX blockchain, offering them additional benefits and rewards when they engage with applications and games on WAX.

2. Strategic Collaborations
- **Rada Quest**: We continue to collaborate with Rada Quest. Some activities within the Rada Quest game grant Coins in Pug Tapper. Additionally, Rada Quest has offered Pug Tapper players the ability to purchase various NFTs in exchange for the Coins earned. These NFTs are used as special cards for the current Coliseum event in Rada Quest, so they are very useful.
- **Meta Battler**: We are also collaborating with Meta Battler, a game that allows players to use NFT WAX from multiple collections to build decks and earn Meta Battler tokens. Some activities in Meta Battler generate Pug Tapper Coins. They have also given away an exclusive NFT for purchase with Pug Tapper Coins.

**Some Metrics**
- **Total players**: 9.3k
- **Daily active players**: 700+
- **Telegram Community**: 1.2k+ members

### WAX Developer Portal (community project)

**URLs**: https://developer.wax.io/

We continue to contribute to the developer documentation portal with new translations into Spanish and tutorials.

We have added an article about using WAX temporary accounts thanks to CloudWallet. While creating the article, a bug was discovered in the waxjs.js service that affected temporary accounts. After informing the WAX ​​team, the bug has been fixed and we were able to complete the tutorial.
