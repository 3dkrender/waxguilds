## WAX Name Service
### Background
[WAX Name Service](https://www.waxnameservice.io) is a marketplace for buying and selling WAX premium names. For example, if you own the premium name “fan” on WAX, you can list it as a suffix on the marketplace and start selling its sub-names like “wax.fan” or “oig.fan.” It’s easy to buy a name on the marketplace - just search for a name you’d like and see all of the available names for sale. There are currently [40 suffixes](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=names&scope=names&limit=100&table=suffixes&action=buyaccount) listed on the marketplace and names can be purchased using Anchor or Wombat wallets.

[Names can be listed by interacting directly with our smart contract](https://eosnation.io/eos-wax-name-service-guide/). All of the [sales and activity for WAX Name Service can be tracked on chain](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names) in any block explorer.

## WAX Detective
[Waxdetective.io](https://waxdetective.io/network) is a blockchain forensics analysis tool for the WAX blockchain that make it easy to analyze patterns of token transfers between accounts. Members of the WAX community have found the service valuable for identifying wash trading in NFT sales and defending against bot activity attacking their applications.
## Spyglass
EOS Nation has continued operating [Spyglass](https://spyglass.network/), alongside our popular [lookup tool for failed transactions on WAX](https://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup) and other Antelope chains.

## Pomelo
### Background:
[Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/) is a [crowdfunding platform supporting the development of public goods](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-is-pomelo-feb059bfd531) for the Antelope ecosystem that leverages [quadratic funding](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/the-magic-of-quadratic-funding-89b9649a6b3a) to amplify the impact of donations according to the wisdom of the crowd. While EOS is currently the only supported payment method, it is open to all projects that benefit the wider Antelope ecosystem. [Many WAX projects have participated](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery) over the past year and received funding to continue building their critical public goods. Since grants need to be public goods to qualify for funding, many of them are open source building blocks that benefit the entire Antelope ecosystem, even if they were originally intended for a specific chain like EOS or Telos. 
### Development Updates:
[Pomelo Bounties beta](https://bounties.pomelo.io) is now live. It initially supports creating and claiming bounties with USDT on EOS and EOS EVM, but it will eventually be available on more chains including WAX. Anyone can now easily fund a GitHub issue with USDT, or complete an issue and claim the USDT.

## Troubleshooting and Testing

  
  
We continue to play an integral role in creating troubleshooting documents, technical discussion videos, and bug fixes for the Antelope ecosystem.We update to the latest versions of nodeos in order to find issues before they are experienced by many other WAX Guilds and BPs on other Antelope chains. We will be testing the next Antelope pre-release when it becomes available.  
  
For this evaluation period, most of our time was spent helping people with questions along with our ongoing monitoring.

Here is a list of some of the new contributions and troubleshooting sessions available to the WAX community on GitHub by [Matthew Darwin](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/created_by/matthewdarwin) & [Yaro Shkvorets](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3AYaroShkvorets).

## Pinax Firehose and Substreams endpoints for WAX
### Background
The [Pinax Firehose and Substream endpoints for WAX](https://pinax.network/en/chain/wax) and [WAX Testnet](https://pinax.network/en/chain/waxtest) are now publicly available to and already powering WAX products like Bountyblok’s Staking task. Pinax is operated by the same team behind EOS Nation, focused on developing and operating blockchain agnostic web3 data services compatible with [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/). [Firehose](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/) and [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/) are the next generation of history and streaming data technology developed by StreamingFast (the original developers of dfuse) and designed to be more affordable, scalable and reliable than dfuse. [Pinax has ported this technology for Antelope](https://github.com/pinax-network/firehose-antelope) chains and has joined The Graph as core developers and the primary operator of this tech stack. We will be working with chains who are interested in being [integrated with The Graph](https://thegraph.com/blog/chain-integration-process/), including WAX if there is appetite to pursue that from the WAX core team. Regardless of integration with The Graph, our free public WAX endpoints are already available, and premium paid plans are coming soon. 
### Latest Updates
Since the launch of our [WAX](https://pinax.network/en/chain/wax) and [WAX Testnet](https://pinax.network/en/chain/waxtest) Firehose & Substreams endpoints in December we’ve already seen a fair amount of usage. Was usage has ranged from ~500GB to 2TB bytes read per day, while WAX Testnet usage has ranged from 4GB-1.7TB bytes read per day.
