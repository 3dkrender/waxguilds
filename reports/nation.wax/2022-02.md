### sk8coin
![sk8coin](https://i0.wp.com/eosnation.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover2.png)
Introducing our interactive digital  NFT magazine powered by flipbook technology and the WAX blockchain network. This NFT based digital magazine features all of the skaters from our alpha series along with new skaters from around the world.

The sk8coin NFT magazine contains claimable links to free NFT drops exclusively available only to magazine holders and gives collectors an entirely new interactive experience while getting to know the skaters they support. Additional features include embedded videos, interactive links, and interviews with skaters and filmers from all parts of the globe that produce the magical content, as well as articles relating to the work it takes to make it all happen.

Collectors can get a glimpse of what it’s like to be in the field directly from the skateboarder’s point of view. We also offer advertisement opportunities for projects looking to get exposure to the community that follows our project. If you enjoy skateboarding culture and NFT games you will absolutely love our new magazine which also includes reviews on the newest and hottest projects on WAX.

The magazine will initially be available on WAX and will expand to other blockchains soon. New issues will be released bi-monthly with each issue featuring interviews with the skaters, film crews, and influencers involved with the project as well as exclusive NFTs only found in these digital magazines. The NFT sets claimed will be fully upgradeable to 5 different levels using our blend fusion technology on Nefty Blocks.

In January, collectors will be able to mint the sk8coin Magazine by [blending all the rare skateboards](https://neftyblocks.com/c/skatecoinwax/blends/super) from the [Virtual Reality Graffiti Battle Season 00 collection](https://wax.atomichub.io/drops/79834+79835).
