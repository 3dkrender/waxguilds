### Hyperion

**URLs**: https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/

**Update**:
This cycle the team is focused on what we are calling the Hyperion Hub, which will consolidate information from participating operators to map performance, usage and availability allowing developers to optimize endpoint selection and operators to direct efforts. The dev team is working on Hyperion log export functionalities and secure connection to the Hub. Repositories and commits are soon to be made public.

This is an important step towards a decentralized infrastructure ecosystem.  

Other than that we keep on supporting the community mainly through the telegram channel.
