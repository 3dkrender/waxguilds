### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

This last cycle marked the launch of QRY Hub. Allowing operators to share data on their services (Chain API, History, Atomic API, etc) and user to choose the most suitable. It is integrated with Nodepulse by Sentnl. This is the first step towards the implementation of QRY, a decentralized API ecosystem that will generate a better option for dApps and users while providing a new revenue stream for operators.
