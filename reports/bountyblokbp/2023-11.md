## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

---

We recently added:
- WAX Testnet History Solution: https://api.wax-test.bountyblok.io/v2/health
- WAX Mainnet Chain API since block 1 (❤️ to WAXSweden for a blocks log copy) (experimenting on the a new AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7970X 32-Core)
- Oracle Pairs USDTUSD and USDCUSD since October 31st

On October 22 there was a network glitch at the hetzner DC causing the NIC to output  Errors `time out loop` - it was intermittent but we kept monitoring it to see if it would resolve on its own before switching to backup. Eventually a hard reboot was required to bring it back online in a stable state.

- Helped WAX team launch the AMC campaign to reward their AMC Entertainment Visa Card Holders.

"The AMC Entertainment Visa Card – the only co-branded movie theater credit card in the United States – launched in April of 2023. AMC Entertainment Visa cardholders earn AMC Stubs rewards points with everyday purchases. Plus, AMC Stubs points accelerate even faster for cardholders for purchases made with the card at gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants and at 
AMC Theatres. This is in addition to AMC Stubs points already earned at AMC Theatres as an AMC Stubs Insider, Premiere or A-List Member. The AMC Entertainment Visa Card is another example of AMC's continued dedication to providing value to moviegoers and strengthening the relationship we have with our loyal moviegoing guests. In recognition of and appreciation for early adopter cardholders, AMC and WAX have partnered to create an exclusive "AMC Entertainment Visa Card" NFT to the WAX Blockchain."

### Ecosystem #5: WAX + Polygon CDK L2

Dimtri Jassy Lukas met with Sanket and Urvit to discuss potentially extend WAX into an infinite scalability and infinite liquidity solution under an L2.

This was actually a big interest to ALL parties involved on the call. We recently included Aaron from WAX to be part of the group.

Still early stages and this is a long term project in steps:

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form.

One small suggestion it to consider adding some new product feature on the Guidelines for evaluating products that offer and have been offering tools for FREE - espcially tools that require and offer free customer support.
