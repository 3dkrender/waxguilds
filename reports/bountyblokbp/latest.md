### NEW Product #5: Official WAX Status 

**URLs**: https://status.wax.io/

**Update** 
* We’re excited to announce the launch of the WAX Network Status Page: https://status.wax.io

Similar to status pages for networks like Sui (status.sui.io) and Solana (status.solana.com), this page monitors major outages and provides updates for the WAX community and builders. It is not intended for OIG to monitor guilds but rather to keep the community informed about issues with:

Block Production: >2/3 of guilds are missing rounds.
Public APIs: >2/3 are down or delayed by >5 minutes.
RNG Oracle: queue exceeds 300.
Core Services: Explorers, marketplaces, WCW website and Wallet APIs.
Mainnet+Testnet.

The status page relies on several Python scripts and cron jobs and will evolve over time with more features. WAX team will be linking it to the wax.io page as well.

Special thanks to: 1) sentnl for the missing rounds API. 2) Anders + Nick for their feedback and suggestions.

The status page is official and the WAX team linked it on their home page
