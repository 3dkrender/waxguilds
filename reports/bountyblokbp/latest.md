* Our team did a bunch of QA on WuffiTap and found some bugs that were fixed since:
  
When I try to connect to OKX, the app opens but nothing happens. Scanning the QR code also opens the OKX app, prompting me to "connect wallet," but the Wuffitap app still doesn't detect the connection, so I can't claim any points. Although the OKX app shows multiple connections to Wuffitap, the issue persists.
