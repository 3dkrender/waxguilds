* [ONGOING] We are working with the Privado ID team (formerly known as Polygon ID) to integrate their web wallet SDK into the contest tool. This will add an extra layer of security to combat bots. Users will need to verify their identity through a face scan, which will store a unique hash to prevent them from using multiple wallets to complete tasks.
