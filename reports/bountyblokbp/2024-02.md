We recently:
- Upgraded WAX Main BP to v5 on Feb 26
- Purchased a 3rd private peer and set it to v5 on Feb 28
- Kept the rest on v4 for now

Empty blocks issue in the last 7 days:
- Empty blocks issues improved a lot in the last few days from our tweaks, versus last week. It is still under observation but we had to remove 2 neighbor peers from eosbrazil (changed IPs) and eosdac (no longer top 21), we also found a few other peers used that were changed for example wax.eosn.io:xxx is now wax.seed.eosnation.io:xxx
- Worked extensively with eosauthority as they had the same issues
- Will keep monitoring/tweaking but avg low tx is a lot better/stable
- We suspect our 2 internal peers shared on Keybase have been over exposed/overloaded, we'll gradually start adjust the FW to control those better
- Our new 3rd private peer is ready to be used any time - we plan to plug it in the BP in the next few days some time

### Ecosystem #5: WUFFI Contribution 40+ hours

We spent 40+ hours on collaborating with WUFFI Team
- On January 31: 

Custom Snapshots: we had to generate different snapshots for each WUFFI tiers: https://bountyblok.io/wax-snapshot-tier1.txt ... https://bountyblok.io/wax-snapshot-tier10.txt and the final: https://bountyblok.io/wax-snapshot-jan-31-1600-pst.txt

Had to build an entire module to generate snapshots from mixed data sources including lightapi, wax api, hyperion - complex case related to wallets with liquid 0 to 1.0000000 WAXP, which is in the millions, causing a lot of timeouts in all querying - we had to find tricks to query this and spent almost 1 week just on that component alone.

Thx EOSAmsterdam for lightapi <3
