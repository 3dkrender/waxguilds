## Deals & developments that positively impact the development of the WAX ecosystem. 

Taco pays the utmost attention in bringing value to the WAX blockchain, onboarding other businesses, providing smart contract developments and useful tools for other projects, encouraging the creation of new communities around Taco and serving as a launchpad for other games.

### Ecosystem #1: NFT World Cup: Bridge, Sponsor, Promotion, Collection

We helped to bridge the NFT World Cup to WAX. NFT World Cup is a product brought by Intraverse which gave life to the XMas Games Fest, a gaming event in collaboration with Wombat and AtomicHub. Taco sponsored the Event. Taco provided to the NFT World Cub visibility throuhg adv banners, by inviting them on our Twitch show and by promoting co-events to our community.
On the bridge side, we provided detailed documentation, helped with the code and development part and gave access to our infrastructure to let their system gather the info from the chain they need through API (atomicassets and RPC). We also helped Intraverse to create their first collection on WAX.
[Intraverse is set to organize the first WAX only event with AtomicHub in December.](https://x.com/AtomicHub/status/1725451556143698013?s=20)

### Ecosystem #3: Taco community outreach
