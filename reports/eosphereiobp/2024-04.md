### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
This last period we have continued rolling out upgrades to WAX v5.0.1 and have updated our WAX Technical How To documention in Medium and on WAX Developers.

Our Perth Data Centre has also now been upgraded to a primary Enterprise 1Gbps Synchronous Internet Connection in preparation for more services to be launched there.

We’ve also added additional hardware, CPU’s, RAM and much needed SAS Disks to our Perth server rack.

### HeadsUp - Monitoring and Alerts

**URLs**: https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts 

**Update**: 
In this last period, the HeadsUp Team have been testing the release candidate that will be used as final for the v0.1 Beta as all phase features have now been incorporated:

- Weighted Alerts
- Alert Reminders
- More Detailed Alerts, include error value, last updated and current value
- Incorporated user requested UI updates
- Modular approach to Metric Processing making it significantly easier to expand the number of metrics and alerts in future.
- Automation of the deployment lifecycle so we can deploy faster and with less risk moving forward.

The plan is to have a rock solid base going forward and we are almost there.

If you would like to give HeadsUp a try, join our Telegram Group (https://t.me/headsup_monitoring_alerts) for github links and instructions on the current stable Alpha release.
