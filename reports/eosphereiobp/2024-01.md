# EOSphere Guild January 2024 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. 

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

We did continue building out services in our Perth DC, progress is slower than we would like but we are getting there.

We have started the process of refreshing our Sydney Data Centre servers, some will be replaced and some will be decommissioned with those services being moved to Perth.

Currently all WAX software nodes are v4.0.4wax01 or above.

We have yet to start rolling our WAX v5.0 but expect to start on the Testnet and then only move to Mainnet.

We are running Atomic v1.3.24 compiled with the recently updated stealth "main" release.

We gather in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 97.41% of Requests are Normal API, 2.59% are Hyperion API
- 18 to 22 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- 280 Million Requests this last two weeks
- 1.3 Million HTTP v1.1 and 309 Thousand HTTP v2.0 WAX Blockchain Push Actions per day.
- 2 Million Requests served by our Atomic API per day

We offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service Level is excellent with close to 100% uptime.

With full history now 27.8TB in size.

We provide transparency of our service availability through our **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform
In the last period, HeadsUp had completed the rewrite of code from Python to Rust and the team were fixing bugs ahead of the Beta v0.1 release. However we encountered some severe stability issues caused but CPU and Memory consumption that rendered the latest build unfit for production.

The HeadsUp team are on the case and currently working through the following:

- CPU, Memory and Disk IO fix
- Code clean up of some old Python config
- Optimisation of the node connects and latency metrics
- Github Actions

Bring on 2024 and bring on HeadsUp Beta v0.1 .. we are almost there.

Join the HeadsUp [Telegram Group](https://t.me/headsup_monitoring_alerts) or go straight to the [Public GitHub](https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts)

We have decided to double our lead developers time per month to ensure the project progresses timeously.

We will continue longterm development of HeadsUp, fixing any issues and adding features each month. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community.

### Snapshot and Backup Services
Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks

_Blocks backups are now archived in strides for easier management and available in Australia and Canada_

- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots

_Mainnet Hyperion Snapshots scheduled to run daily_

- Full Mainnet State-History Backup with corresponding Blocks and Snapshot

_Available in Australia and Canada_

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still very well used (running off our 64TB storage server), saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
### Twitter
We are active on our twitter feed with over 5,000 followers and are absolutely a strong marketing and engagement channel for WAX https://twitter.com/eosphere_io.

### WAX Technical How To
We regularly publish a series of articles called **“WAX Technical How To”**. 

**This month we created a guide that is slightly different to our usual blockchain focus and is on TCP BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round Trip propagation time). TCP BBR is an alternate congestion control algorithm to the normal Cubic in Ubuntu and may bring benefits to latent or high packet loss networks..**

Implement TCP BBR Congestion Control

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Below are the latest engagement stats from medium:

We have continued to convert and add our guides to the *New* Format WAX Developer Github. (https://developer.wax.io/operate/wax-infrastructure/) 

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
None at this time, love your work.
