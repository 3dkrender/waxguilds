### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We had a disk array failure on a Canada DC storage server, this array was hosting our WAX Mainnet Hyperion ES Snapshots. The array has been repaired however Hyperion ES Snapshots are now being hosted in our Perth DC for the short term.

We had a planned 3rd Party ISP network outage in Perth on the 20th of August. Perth was down for 105mins and returned to full production without any issues. WAX Testnet API's and WAX Mainnet Hyperion Full History was effected.

HeadsUp v0.1.3 was released.

Be sure to check out the public showcase of HeadsUp to get a feel for the platforms capability here -> https://headsup.eosphere.io/

We are also currently planning to refresh our servers in Sydney, this will probably happen at the end of September 2024.

Our upgrades to v5.0.1wax01 are organically being completed.

**Update**: 
If you are technically curious or interested in running services on the WAX network, be sure to have a look at our WAX Technical How To series published monthly in the EOSphere Blog on Medium.

These guides are being added to the WAX Developer GitHub.

At this point, we unfortunately arenâ€™t able to provide this service to other WAX Guilds. However, you are welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API.

Please contact us at info@eosphere.io to discuss your needs so we can craft a suitable solution for you.
