### HeadsUp - Monitoring and Alerts

**URLs**: https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts 

**Update**: 

The EOSphere Team will be releasing HeadsUp v0.2.0 this month.

This release is a clean up of the code base and includes front end caching performance changes.

Over 8000 lines of code have been removed and the code framework is now structured in a more modular way. This means better operational efficiency and simpler feature additions.

Take a look at the public showcase -> https://headsup.eosphere.io/

These guides are being added to the WAX Developer GitHub.

This months guide walks through considerations and configuration on how to ensure a Block Producer nodeâ€™s CPU use is optimised for the WAX Protocol Network based on our experience.
