### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
Our WAX Hyperion Full History Service for Mainnet has been operating out of our Perth DC without any performance issues, we are also still providing daily snapshots of the Elasticsearch store now being created from the Perth cluster.

We had a planned 3rd Party ISP network outage in Perth on the 4th of July. Perth was down for 90mins and returned to full production without any issues. WAX Testnet API's and WAX Mainnet Hyperion Full History was effected.

The highlight of this last period is the release of HeadsUp v0.1 which was a golden milestone that's taken 2 years to achieve. HeadsUp is now a rock solid platform from which we will continue to build features on.

Be sure to check out the public showcase of HeadsUp to get a feel for the platforms capability here -> https://headsup.eosphere.io/

Our upgrades to v5.0.1wax01 are ongoing.

### <ins>Feedback to OIG</ins>
The public seed requirement of > 95% SLR should take into account additional provided seed services from the same provider. For example we have two public seed nodes, if one is offline for 50% and the other is 100% available this should still be regarded as a SLR pass.

We liking this report update format.
