### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
No outages were experienced this last period.

HeadsUp v0.1.7 was released.

Be sure to check out the public showcase of HeadsUp to get a feel for the platforms capability here -> https://headsup.eosphere.io/

We’ve had a few issues with our new AMD EPYC server in Sydney, mainly to do with the internet routing capability of our services provider. I expect us to have these resolved over the next few weeks when end of year change embargo’s are over.

Perth servers have successfully had their RAM upgraded, this should give us some runway before we need to upgrade to new platforms.
