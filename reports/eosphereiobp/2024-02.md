# EOSphere Guild February 2024 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. 

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

Our Perth Data Centre has received new Hyperscale Dell Hardware, this will be used to more effectively expand our WAX Hyperion Storage.

Currently all WAX software nodes are v4.0.4wax01 or above.

We have started rolling out node upgrades to WAX v5.0.1 using the latest Antelope Leap code (We wrote an article on our v5.0 findings this month), Testnet is already upgraded.

We gather in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 95.59% of Requests are Normal API, 4.41% are Hyperion API
- 13 to 15 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- 220 Million Requests this last two weeks
- 1.2 Million HTTP v1.1 and 215 Thousand HTTP v2.0 WAX Blockchain Successful Push Actions per day.
- 2 Million Requests served by our Atomic API per day

We offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service Level is excellent with close to 100% uptime.

With full history now 28.3TB in size.

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform
In this last period, the HeadsUp Team have continued the road to v0.1

A bug was found in the Ingestor causing it to restart that was fixed. Additionally the connects and latency operation was modified to provide more detail to some of the complex metrics.

The next release will enable the below features:

**Alert Frequency Customisation**, users are able to set alert reminders at a frequency of their choosing.
**Weighted Alerts**, users can set a threshold for the number of times an metric must fail before alerting the user.
**Alert History Customisation**, users can choose how long archived alerts are maintained.
**Additional Detail in Alert Data**, new fields displayed in alerts such as report value, last value and the number of notifications for an alert.

HeadsUp Beta v0.1 is soo close we are almost there.

The plan of action over the next 6 weeks is 2 additional code merges above the current v0.0.199 , then testing of this code without any additional operational changes. If all is successful that release will be changed to v0.1 Beta.

Join the HeadsUp [Telegram Group](https://t.me/headsup_monitoring_alerts) or go straight to the [Public GitHub](https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts)

We will continue longterm development of HeadsUp, fixing any issues and adding features each month.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community.

### Snapshot and Backup Services
Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks

_Blocks backups are now archived in strides for easier management and available in Australia and Canada_

- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots

_Mainnet Hyperion Snapshots scheduled to run daily_

- Full Mainnet State-History Backup with corresponding Blocks and Snapshot

_Available in Australia and Canada_

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still very well used (running off our 64TB storage server), saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

We have continued to convert and add our guides to the *New* Format WAX Developer Github. (https://developer.wax.io/operate/wax-infrastructure/) 

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
None at this time, we are still optimistic with the price of $WAX this Bull Run.
