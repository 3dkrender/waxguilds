# EOSphere Guild November 2023 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. 

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

This last month we have restructured our Perth Australia Disaster Recovery (DR) site into more of a Data Centre (DC) with services now being delivered out of Perth directly. The main reason for this change was us purchasing storage media outright (SAS, SSD, NVMe Disks) rather than leasing from an infra provider. This gives us a far better cost scaling as our Guild continues to grow.

We also upgraded our Hyperion Redis and RabbitMQ software to keep in line with the latest Hyperion v3.3.9–8 our service interruption was minimal.

We made the short term DB changes to our WAX Atomic API service on the 26/11 and will implement the required software update when available.

We gather in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 94.87% of Requests are Normal API, 5.13% are Hyperion API
- 20 to 24 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- 340 Million Requests this last two weeks
- 2 Million Requests served by our Atomic API per day

We offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service Level is excellent with close to 100% uptime.

With full history now 27.2TB in size.

We provide transparency of our service availability through our **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

### HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform
HeadsUp has completed the rewrite of code from Python to Rust. The platform is now running very efficiently and the final gremlins are being ironed out for our **Beta v0.1** release.

An awesome piece of information is that HeadsUp actually picked up the Atomic Assets Database oversight as it happened and alerted our team.

The current release of HeadsUp is **v0.0.188** and includes the following features:

- Removal of the Python Ingestor Container in it’s entirety
- All services migrated to Rust
- Update to the traffic light system on the Home and Chain Pages to reflect node state
- Complete GUI change and re-imagining of the alerts panel making it far simpler to view and silence alerts.
- Low CPU utilisation :)
- Other bugs and fixes

The next features/fixes currently being worked on are:

- Persistent Chain view configuration
- Customisable alert reminders
- Customisable alert history retention
- View alerts by time and date
- Bugs and fixes for Beta V0.1

Join the HeadsUp [Telegram Group](https://t.me/headsup_monitoring_alerts) or go straight to the [Public GitHub](https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts)

We will continue longterm development of HeadsUp, fixing any issues and adding features each month.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community.

### Snapshot and Backup Services
Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks

_Blocks backups are now archived in strides for easier management and available in Australia and Canada_
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots

_Mainnet Hyperion Snapshots scheduled to run daily_
- Full Mainnet State-History Backup with corresponding Blocks and Snapshot

_Available in Australia and Canada_

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still very well used (running off our 64TB storage server), saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API


### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements. Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. 
We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

### WAX Technical How To

**This month we created a guide on using WAX Software Block Strides to make archiving and handling the blocks.log more manageable.**

Managing WAX Blocks Data with Strides

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Below are the latest engagement stats from medium:

We have continued to convert and add our guides to the *New* Format WAX Developer Github. (https://developer.wax.io/operate/wax-infrastructure/) 

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
None at this time, best of luck with the election.
