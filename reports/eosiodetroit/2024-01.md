** WAX Labs Tutorial **
The a near final draft of “How to Submit a WAX Labs Proposal” and the beginning of the WAX Labs section in the official developer documentation was written and can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cG6Z1VFnjQr3o-G06ag0yQSpzgsvSYgMN3duuaXv-AI/edit

The proposal also includes a template that proposers can use to structure their proposals better. DLT needs review by the OIG to confirm a couple aspects of the review process. Once reviewed, DLT will convert to markdown and submit the tutorial to the WAX Developer Documentation website.
