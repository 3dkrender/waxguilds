### Nodesuite

**URLs**: https://github.com/eosdetroit/nodesuite 

**List of SCs**: N/A

**Update**: 
* Minor Changes:
  * Updated local debian packages and variable defaults to latest releases (wax-leap/leap/spring)
  * Updated nodeos configuration template to deploy variables exclusive to eosio/leap/spring based on release_name


### WAX Labs

**URLs**: https://labs.wax.io, https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-labs-ui 

**List of SCs**: labs.wax

**Update**: 
* We met with the WAX team to determine the best way to optimize the deployment. The deployment process no longer requires us to send the WAX team an IPFS hash. Updates will automatically be deployed in production when the branch is merged into the main branch of the repository owned by the WAX team.
* The filter for deliverables in need of review was deployed to production and can be toggled by clicking the All Proposals header. https://labs.wax.io/proposals?whose=Deliverables+to+review
* Claiming of deliverables has been updated so that all required actions to receive the funds are handled via a single button click in the UI (similar to how V2 worked). We need the IGs to verify this works on mainnet with one of the project owners.
* The number of requests being sent when filtering proposals was decreased in some instances.

### FACINGS Studio / Creator

**URLs**: https://dashboard.dev.facings.io, https://creator.facings.io, https://github.com/facings/collection-manager

* No updates specifically to the open source Creator platform.

### Pantheon (Game)
