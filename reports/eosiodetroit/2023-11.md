**WAX Labs**

During this past evaluation period, the third milestone was approved and paid by the WAX team, thus marking the official completion of the project.

Shortly after the project was completed, DLT began handling bug fixes reported by the WAX team and the community. The various fixes that were delivered post-launch are:



The team is in discussions with the OIG about future major enhancements to the WAX Labs platform by providing the WAX team and IGs with the ability to solicit Request for Proposals (RFPs) and for community members / DAOs to create non-equity crowdfunding/kickstarter campaigns to build projects on WAX.

**FACINGS**

*FACINGS Creator (NFT Collection Manager)*

Over the past reporting period, the FACINGS team performed a number of maintenance updates to the private collection manager that will be incorporated into an upcoming release to the public open-source repository. The following updates were made:

Styling to scroll bars throughout the UI
Bug fix on a filter within the airdrop tool
Disable a portion of the click area on NFTs in certain views

FACINGS’ goal is to provide a streamlined and intuitive experience for creators to manage their NFT collections. The initial version provides core features needed to interact with AtomicAssets functionality on WAX and EOS. DLT engineers also regularly contribute to this project directly in addition to FACINGS engineers.

*FACINGS Core Platform*

The FACINGS product team spent the majority of its effort over the past 6 weeks working on what will become its monetized product. The first major component being worked on is creating the draft and publish flow that will make it easier for creators to manage large releases and work on them over time. One major difference between the full product is that it also uses a traditional backend to store information for a variety of tools of features off-chain until it’s ready for final release. Employing a traditional backend will allow the team to more easily abstract bulk execution of on-chain transactions away from the end user. Most of the wireframe and mockup work for the draft and publish flow has been completed in advance. The work that FACINGS is completing now will be used for a future game release with a client DLT has brought to the WAX ecosystem on a signed contract.

**WAX OIG Governance Portal**

During the last reporting period, the DLT team completed two major WAX Labs milestones related to the OIG Governance Portal. These projects performed the work that allowed the OIG election to take place on schedule, primarily the nomination and voting processes of the election.

Members of the DLT also helped with on-call support and bug fixes during the beginning of each phase of the election.

The DLT also scoped and delivered the proposal for WAX OIG Governance Portal version 2.1. The next version of this project will focus on providing an interface for IG and Guild admin actions. It also includes a public proxy voting portal to promote community staking and earning yield through governance participation.

**Antelope Open Block Explorer (community tools)**

The DLT team recently deployed the multi-chain (including WAX) version of Open Block Explorer to https://explorer.antelope.io. The DLT team has been supporting the open block explorer project through development efforts as a part of the Telos Core Developers and KOY Network team for over a year. The WAX version of the explorer has benefited from some of the past development efforts funded by these entities and performed by the DLT team, such as the msig creator tool.

In addition, the DLT team raised funding for the development work completing the multichain work through various avenues such as Pomelo and Eden on EOS grants.
