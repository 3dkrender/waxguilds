## Product Development

**Ansible Nodesuite**

New Release: Leap 5.0 / Nodeos Monitoring & Alerting

- Configurations are now optimized for Leap 5.0 and nodesuite will no longer be supporting previous versions.
- Added initialize-nodeos-monitor monitoring playbook: Supply a slack webhook URL or Pushover keys and receive custom slack or mobile alerts based upon the severity of the detected event. Use Pushover to request acknowledgement of outages or even override Do-Not-Disturb on mobile devices in the event of a nodeos failure.

*Due to the addition and removal of various variables / flags within nodeos, if you specify an older version of Leap (<5.0.0), the configuration generated may no longer allow nodeos to launch.*
*It is recommended you are running Ubuntu Server 22.04 on your target hosts while using nodesuite!

*FACINGS Core Platform*

The FACINGS team has made good progress on the development of its core platform. Importing and syncing Atomic Asset NFT collections is completed and working well. Numerous improvements have been made to the UI and background queue cron job, which helps provide a seamless experience for the end user. The team is currently focused on finishing the publishing workflow.
This work will be used and tested for the upcoming Pantheon release, a game DLT is developing on WAX that should have a playable proof of concept by the end of March.

DLT will work to set up a meeting with IGs in the coming weeks to receive a demo of what FACINGS has built thus far, with the intention of offering the service to the public when completed.

**WAX OIG Governance Portal**


No improvements were made to the OIG portal this reporting period. DLT is committed to making any maintenance, bug fixes, or reasonable improvements to the platform when needed. DLT also believes the OIG Portal could be a candidate for translation after the WAX Developer portal translation work is complete.

The OIG Governance Portal v2.1 proposal is outstanding and on hold until further notice from the IGs and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MfWrtHyJTrzXjKKnLjUza7NJz9y7CJMLjJrhLeiB1ok/edit?usp=sharing).

## Community Engagement

** Developer Documentation Contributions**

During this reporting period, the final draft of the WAX Labs How-To tutorial submitted last reporting period was completed, converted to markdown, and merged into the public github repository. The How-To pull request can be found [here](https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/159).

Additionally, the DLT team submitted the Chinese translation of the “Learn” section and the configuration work required to enable Chinese language urls on the WAX Developer website. That work can be found [here](https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/158). DLT will be working towards completely translating the developer documentation website into Chinese over the coming months. DLT is now in the process of translating the “Build” section. The translations are performed and reviewed by a native Chinese national.

Finally, the DLT team also began translating the developer documentation into Portuguese and has completed the configuration and scaffolding work needed to facilitate translating the “Learn” section. The branch containing the work in progress can be found [here](https://github.com/eosiodetroit-adam/wax-developer/tree/Portuguese). The team will closely follow the Chinese language translation schedule. DLT will be working towards completely translating the developer documentation website into Portuguese over the coming months. The Portuguese translations are being performed and reviewed by DLT’s Brazilian development team members.

The translation of the WAX Developer website into Chinese and Portuguese means that WAX Developer will be accessible to 1st (English), 2nd (Chinese), and 9th (Portuguese) most commonly spoken languages in the World.
